4 types of gult:
1) Criminal - violating laws, need proof, Jurisdiction is needed.
2) Political guild - involves the deeds of statesman, and implies that citizens of the state have to bear the consequences of the actions of their state. If such state is defeated militarily then the victor will choose the consequences. Citizens have to look for arbitrary power in state in order to prevent it. Jurisdiction comes from the power that defeats.
3) Moral guild - “I, who cannot act otherwise than as an individual, am morally responsible for all my deeds, including the execution of political and military orders. It is never simply true that ‘orders are orders.’” Jurisdiction comes from conscience and communication with friends and who loves you.
4) Metaphysical guild - “There exists a solidarity among men as humans that makes each co-responsible for every wrong and every injustice in the world, especially for crimes committed in his presence or with his knowledge. If I fail whatever I can do to prevent them, I too am guilty.”

The last one is complicated as it may justify suicide bombing for example. Also this guilt is manipulated the most (R. J. Rushdoony (The Politics of Guilt and Pity))

Self-justification is important part of the guilt.
The concept of metaphysical guilt can too easily be used as a political tool by people to extort benefits from others or avoid accepting personal responsibility.
