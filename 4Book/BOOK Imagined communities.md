# BOOK Imagined communities

Benedict Anderson 1983

1978-79 first large scale conventional war betwen marxist countries - Vietnal and Cambodia
Eric Hubsbawn says that marxist states tend to become nationalistic 
...


Three paradoxes of nationalism:
 - Modernity in historian eyes vs antiquitiy in nationalist eyes
 - Everyone should and will have a nationality (as a gender) vs most manifestations are very special and not possible to standartize
 - Political power of national idea vs philosophical incoherence


*I think we should view the nationalism in metamodern way - we agree that it is relatively new and very incoherent concept which is nevertheless a very important tool for communities we already have.*

Nationalism has never produced its own great thinkers - no "Hobbeses, Tocqueveilles, Marxes or Webers".

Author says that nationalism is closer to "kinship" or "religion" then to "liberalism" or "fascism".

Nation - imagined political community. (*But every abstract thing is imagined - the definition is not very defining then*)
Imagined in a sense that you do not know personally all the members yet you think you are in onecommunity (*Yet I think you have simmilar experience so you are in one community*)

 nationalism as an anomaly in Marxist theory and thus not theorized/conceptualized

first communities where sharing
 - sacred language
 - sacred cosmology
 - dynastic power




# Cultural roots
A lot of nations have Unknown Soldier tombs. It feels like it is a feature of the nationalism. And if nationalism is deeply concerned with death (unlike marxism and liberalism) it feels more like religion.

Religion is often concerned with mortality so it transforms it to continuity (krama, original sin, etc).

Nationalism is closer to religion and culture then to ideaology
*This is an ideologized form of the culture*

### Religious community
Sacred text signed language created communities which could understand each other.

All communities saw themselves as cosmically central by medium of their sacred language.

Great communities of the past talk through the silent languages.
Non interchangeability of languages is first important idea that bound the societies. For example Quaran was considered to be impossible to translate.
There is no idea of the world so separated from the language that languages are interchangeable.
this was the attituede to a church latin, qur'anic arabic, examination chineese, but not to church greek (maybe because it was still widely spoken)
*The fact that the language is dead seem to play an important role if it gets the position of the language of truth*
And therefore the language was used to determine the belonning. You belong to the community if you understand the language of truth.
Second important idea of such communities is hierarchy between literati and society. Literati are the medium between people and the truth.

Nationalism is horizontal and boundary oriented instead.

*it was not evident that making people learn other languages removed the sacrity of a written language and undermined religious communities*

Prinitng press led to fall of the sacular language and the fragmentation of sacred communities.

*Nationalism is self reflected ethnos*

### The dynastic realm
In older imagining state is a center. Strictly defined borders is an invention of nationalism. Sovereignties merged smoothly. That is why it was easy to rule over versatile lands.
As the legitimacy of the monarchy was divine it did not need any evidence of being "english" when you are in London, etc. 
But during the 17th century as religious communities started fading - dynastic legitimacy changed too.

1648 Charles Stuart - first modern revolution

Since 1789 Europe monarchies had to defend themselves as they became slowly a semi civilized form of government.


### Apprehensions of time
Medieval Christian did not persieve time as an endless chain of cause and effect. Also he saw himself at the end of the times. Christians have a horizontal dimension. 

Old way of perception is - time like a book. Everything is predetermind and happens simmultaniously.
Modern percepltion - time is a news papaer. Simmultanius is something that happens in one point of time.

Joze Rizal is a father of Filippino nationalism.

Nationalism appeared where three axioms faded
 - Script language offers privileged access to the ontological truth precisely because it is a inseparable part of the truth
 - It is natural to organize around monarchs which power is divine
 - Notion of time in which cosmology and history are inseparable, everyday fatalities have meaning

When these ideas faded people needed new ways of linking fraternity, power and time together. And print capitalism helped here a lot.

## The origin of national consciousness

By 1500 20mils books were already printed.

1. Printing  press. Before the printing press a book was an arcane because is had a status of a text, but now it is what is inside the book is important.
2. Reformation. Previously the church defeated heresy because it had better communication. But for example martin luther became the first best selling author - that is something that is hard to compete. Francois 1535 banned all printing

All these books where printed in a spoken language which undermined the status if Latin laguage

It also created a lnguage of power - printed language - new form of older administrative valnaculars. Their cousins which where unsuccessful upon insisting their print form. That is why some languages fought for breaking into print and then radio)

Soviet union did compulsory anti-islamic anti persion romanization and then in 1930 russifying compulsory russification.

It was important for nation states to determine their print language. And this process was very unprecise which is why late 19 mid 20 century had seen so many nations straving for their nation states or at least print state of their language.

A  nation has 4 attributes
 - imagined (you do not know every member)
 - limited (some boundaries beyond which lies other nations)
 - sovereign (born in context of Enlightened ideas?)
 - community (horizontal comradership)

4 topologies of nationalism
 - creole nationalism - creole elites want separation, they are strengthened with print capitalism which generates provincial communities of readers of newspapersб bureaucratic journeys (which showed how things could be) of colonial civil servants, limited by the borders of administrative unit and the arbitrary discrimination and limitations established by the metropolises. American independence movements where successful creole nationalism. 
 - vernacular/popular nationalism - inspired by the french revolution, based on regional language and literature and history. Examples are Hungary and Finland. This nationalism could be partially inspired by the creole nationalism and french revolution. These events gave popular nationalism it's symbols, created a model which had to be repeated in order to be viewed as nationalism - national sovereignty, republic, citizenship, suffrage and so on. This has to be constructed and printed using vernacular tongues.
 - official nationalism. As vernacular nationalism grew in popularity it generated a response from the privileged and dynastic classes which feared exclusion from new nations, lack of legitimacy because of eroding divine origins of power. *Russia destroyed its' vernacular nationalism (decabrists) and created official. That is why it is so easy to attack its foundations - they are in a sense more artificial then in any vernacular nationalism. That is the case because this nationalism was constructed not to reflect on the given community, but to prevent other imagined communities from their "rightful" in terms of nationalism self-determination. Every national myth has fabrications. They are done to make the story complete and heroic, to show that given nation is ancient, evident and aligned with MODERN values of the community. But official nationalism has an additional goal - it has to discriminate other nationalisms, it is reactive by it's nature and sometimes it is absolutely necessary to fabricate things in irder to discriminate. And this descrimination requires constant revision becuase it has to be done in modern value system, which might be very flexible in athritarian regimes. Also top down way of creating the nationalism is blind to cultural intricacies of the nation it is trying to depict.* Policy making, vernacular language promotion through centralized education is linking dynasty to nation and national feelings. Examples are tsarist russification and british anglicization of colonies. *I think that that is a reason why russian national idea is so fabricated, but then British national idea should be fabricated too?*
- Decolonial nationalism. Post ww2 wave of nationalism. Takes the same elements. Bilingual intelligentsias follow republican values of creole, print capitalism and populism of the popular, and the centralizing policies of the official nationalisms and often carefully plan their revolutions (Cambodia or Vietnam). Some instrumentalization of nationalistic feeling became possible.

#### instrumentalization:
 - language as an emblem. Appealing to national language to legitimize position, *also spread language* . That is where we have so much interest in classifying languages.
 -  peoples (race). Starting from the 1870th people where studied and categorized which led to more classification and attempts to create hierarchies. Also citizenship and nationality as a part of bureaucracy (you have a document about that). It sets clear limits to your community.
 - history is essential. Nation is unique and eternal - that is the main task of the history (*is you are an official nationalism you have to show that compiting nations are young and not unique*.). Change from cosmological to linear time helped here (*but what about christianity that introduced not cyclic time - isn't it already linear?*). This inventions helped to colidify the notion of "empty and homogeneous time"
	 - literature
	 - newspaper
	 - clock
	 - calendar
	Also comparative historical studies lead to concious manipulation, writting and forgetting of collective history. Random concatanations of events become models and phenomena (french and bolshevik revolutions), individuals become national figures, with words they would not understand put in their mouths. Collective death and wars are seen as sacrifices. Todat nationalism is dependant on the fact that nationalism is imagined (nations are recognized post factum, many historical figures do not know anything about nations for which they are heroes). 
	Only selected history can be taught through books, museums, monument and education. All that is aimed at teaching a special selected parts of event that reinforce the myth.
 - religion. Confessionality might be instrumentalized. Not every nation but for example irish, serbian (orthodox and antiislamic), israel, iranian (shiite)
 -  territory. Specially creation of maps. Drawings and colorings, border controls and trade customs all reinforce this idea. Space became contested. State become border centric - not center centric.
 - nation itself got symbols and anthems. So it is recognizable. Symbols also became reproducable and identifiable.

#### excusive character
close to racism but "nationalism thinks in terms of historical destiny, racism thinks of eternal contaminations".  *Having a proper story behind nationalism might unity the diverse and divide the similar*.  

#### material self-interest
Culture is important but many times it is tied to economic and political ideas. Revolutions aspire to control the state. Patriotism might want you to sacrifice yourself but usually for killing others.

#### modularity
historical events become models that can be imitated. 


Author of review says that Anderson lacks clear definition of nationalism we are unable to differentiate processes like:
 - movements of unification (Germany in the 60-70s, Italy in the 50s-60s, the Anschluss or more recent Crimea or ISIS),
 - separatist movements (Catalonia, Quebec, Tibet, Basque Country, Scotland or the Kurds),
 - national disintegrations (the USSR, Yugoslavia, Gran Colombia or Austro-Hungary),
 -  the coexistence of political, linguistic, cultural, geographical or religious divisions (Switzerland, Belgium, Indonesia) 
 - the existence of stateless peoples (the Kurds or the Jews until recently).
