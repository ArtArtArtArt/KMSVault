# PROJECT culture simulator

Culture simulation game.

Every community (approx several hundred people) share the same language.

They have 100 names for the biom (tree name, etc).
Some names for their professions (smith, hunter).
Names for geographical objects (mountain, river name).
Names for other percieved groups (barbarians, etc.).
Names for cosmology (god of wind etc.).
Names for feelings (sad, angry).
Names for common objects (hand, eyes, help).
Names for customs (celebration, wedding etc.)

Fashion is a meme.
Communication signs memes.
Recreation.
Food.

Communities invent random memes.
Neighboring communities might take them.
Also they try to invent their own meme too.

At one point we will get meme continuum - communities that differ more the longer the distance.

Communities might create the names. 
But when do we have names for bigger communities?

Constant contact with someone with the same differences later creates a name for them.
Entities might have several names.

Non written cosmology, values and customs.
If something is representative of a value - then it has higher chance of spreading.

Name generation - geography, profession, behavior, fashion.
