History of interaction

- Realists
- Priests
- Magical creatures (dominated their planets because of the magic abilities and might evolve enough to get language, but usually they lack hands to expand so fast)
- AntiReligious groups

Realist-Priest relations:
Many points of contention. 
Realist say about magic beacons of an ancient civ. They presume it is a 4dim warping, telekinesis is also holding an object in 4dim. There were many experiments that even suggested the looks of some parts of this machine (objects are lifted using square plates)

Priest says that there were many exceptions to these experimetns, they have a proof that experiments were lobbied by anti religious groups which fight for power.
