Questions about the world building:
https://www.sfwa.org/2009/08/04/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/

### Basics
-   Are the laws of nature and physics actually different in this world, or are they the same as in real life? How does magic fit in? How do magical beasts fit in?
*Same physics laws, magic is hidden tech which uses 4th dimension to transfer resources from one place to another. That helps you use telekinetically some machines that can influence world anywhere. Specially telepathic stuff. Magical beasts are animals who got control over these machines. In order to give orders to a machine you have to have your brain vibrating on a special frequency. Some animals have it already, some do not. These 4 dim machines are somewhere in the space presumably between the galaxies and we do not know where they are. We can travel between the stars using anomalies in space. They help make time skip in the future the further you move into the anomaly. We also noticed that we can move these anomalies with a special resource - and the construction of "highways" is in process.
**how was it discovered??** The magical towers are not discovered by people, that is why magic created a new religion. This creates two social groups - priests (cultists) and realists(*
-   Is this generally an earth-like world? Is it an “alternate Earth”?
*This world consists of many habitable earthlike planets.*
-   Are there different human races, whether or not there are non-humans like elves or dwarves? How does the cultural and ethnic diversity of this world compare to the real world?
*No human like or intelligent race except people are in the universe. People do not control or visited most of the galaxy.*
-   How long have there been people on this world? Did they evolve, or did they migrate from somewhere/when else?
-   How many people are there in this country? How does this compare with world population? What is considered a small town/large town/city in terms of number of people?
-   Where does magic power come from: the gods, the “mana” of the world (as in Larry Niven’s “Warlock” stories), the personal willpower or life force of the magician, somewhere else? Is magic an exhaustible resource? If a magician must feed his spells with his own willpower, life-force, or sanity, what long-term effects will this have on the health and/or stability of the magician? Do different races/species have different sources for their magic, or does everybody use the same one?

### Alternate Earth 
-   Are there non-human inhabitants of this planet (elves, dwarves, aliens)? If so, how numerous? How openly present? What areas do they occupy (examples: dwarves in mountains or caves, elves in forests, etc.)?
-   How similar are the history and culture of the alternate earth to real history and culture? Why is it so similar/different?
-   Is there a specific historical point where this world split off from ours (e.g., Napoleon won at Waterloo)? If so, what was it? How long ago was it? How much has changed and will continue to change as a result? Is the split in history a result of the presence of magic, or is the change the thing that made workable magic a possibility?
-   If there is no specific point of divergence, what are the differences between this imaginary world and the real one? How obvious are they in everyday life? If magic exists but history is more or less the same, why has it had no effect? If magic works, elves exist, etc., but most people don’t know it, how and why has this been kept secret?
-   If magic is known to exist, which historical events have changed and which are the same? How have organized religions reacted? Governments? Ordinary people? What laws and/or professions are different? What effect will the general and specific differences have on the social questions below?
