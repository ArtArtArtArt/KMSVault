people respond to those who have the same emotional need

so if you artificially stop caring - you are at the same level of emotional need as a person who just got to know you (**it is alike Stuart Lee and hos way of working with the audience**)


so if you notice your emotional need are not met - then withdraw, or check if the fact that there is no such emotional need from that side influences your emotional need.
