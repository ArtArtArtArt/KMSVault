Christian Atheist - does not believe in god but is interested in Christianity
Hegel - what dies on the cross in not Christ - what dies on the cross is the God of the beyond (the idea of a transindental diety) and we get Trinity (god that can be percieved??)
And this is also a god who (for a moment) does not believe in himself (Father why have you forsake me?)
