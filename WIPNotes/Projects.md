- Diplomatic strategy like EU4. 
	   Pillars: balance of power through diplomacy, tech edge can help with rapid expansion
	   Each cell is ne army. Tech can give you temporary advantage.  Defending is easier then attacking. You make alliances to protect yourself and use every opportunity to grab land from a weak neighbor. New territories need time to be integrated and thus give you more troops. You also have wild cards for additional attack, protection of some borders, covert actions in another country (which prevents it from attacking in the near future) and tech. Also you wait for justifications. Some event cards may open the opportunity. Attacking alliance has to be passive for X amount of years. Tech gives the edge but does not guarantee the victory against the same opponent.
	   The tech can drive the game to the periods of peace and war. Defense is stronger then peace - otherwise war.
	   Country may choose to destroy one unit for the tech? Country may also get the tech by fighting the war (which can help someone to steamroll) 
	   Attack without claim is possible but gives a debuf.
	   Countries get temporary bufs and debufs all the time.
	   Tech us a permanent buff.
	   Protection against overextension is debufs too. 

	   Gameloop: 
		   1. Make alliances for protection
		   2. Make claims
		   3. Wait for opportunity (tech, attack alliance possible, someone became weaker etc.)
		   4. Make war

	Implementation steps:
	AI which plays this game. It uses hexagons. It does not have a UI.

- Horror game - I want to make sound design for it
- Logistics based warno - you set up logistics and units are fighting according to what doctrines that you set up for them (maybe start with a blue print for wargame like strategy)
- Dialog based story (+ science based worldbuilding)
