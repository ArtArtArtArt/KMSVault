# Goals
At some point I have to put my own goals. Each category that I have should lead somewhere. Sometimes I do not know where it leads, but I should try to create MOCs all the time.

I also have to review tags and merge them - I think tags are useless mostly. It is better to add connections while reviewing constantly my notes and then watch what clusters appear naturally. MOCs are useless too.
