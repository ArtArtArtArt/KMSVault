Between 1914-1915 regular and reservists were the main contingent of the army (4,5 mil) - they almost all ceased to exist by autumn 1915.

Second contingent - professional stuff and home guard (6,3 mil). By autumn 1916 it suffered considerable losses.

Third contingent - some professional stuff, untrained home guard soldiers and mostly conscripted draftees (4,2 mil). This contingent experienced severe morale crisis which in 1917 grew into collapse of the military machine.

First contingent was well trained and professional
Second was badly trained
Third was almost openly antiwar and had experience in revolutionary events of 1905-6

By the end of the war army composition reflected social composition of the russian empire.

## “Cheerful Attitudes” in the Russian Army

Until 1917 soldiers had cheerful attitude towards the war. They were fighting for  “just cause”, “truth”, or the “defense of brother Slavs” - but did not specify what that meant.

## The Peasant Mentality as the Basis of Attitudes in the Russian Army
As more peasants came to an army the rhetoric changed to a more passive one : “destined”, “compelled”, “fate”, “as the Lord wills”, “such a fate”, “to end up in military service, to defend one’s homeland, and the tsar our father”.

## The Role of Military Experience in Changing the Attitudes of the Russian Army

## War Crimes as an Indicator of the Decline in Morale
Percentage of surrendering as a prisoner or going missing for each year (starting 1914):
5.3, 37.5, 41.4, and 15.8

By march 1917 ~195000 deserted
By August 1917  ~442000 deserted

Total number of deserters in Germany (35-45000) and Britain (35000)

Deserters generated a lot of discontent and crimes in the country.

Self-inflicted wounds is another way to exit the war - usually 25-35 percent of all wounds. But in WW1 in russia this number was 45-55 percent.

Cases of fraternization with the enemy started to mount.
Also embezzlement of military equipment.

## The Dynamics of the Moral Crisis in the Army
Rise of enthusiasm **the summer and autumn of 1914**
And decline in the **autumn of 1914 and the winter of 1915** - and as a result a campaign of "spy mania" and “the enemy’s brutality”
**spring-summer 1915** - rise
and in the **autumn of** **1915 and the spring of 1916**, the army again experienced a moral crisis
After the rise in morale **in the spring and summer of 1916**, which was associated with the Brusilov offensive beginning in October - and after that only the crisis up until the revolution.

## The Implementation of the “Internal Enemy” in the Attitude of the Masses of Soldiers

**The peasant soldiers, viewed its presence at the front as a family task with the condition that this family would be provided for in the face of wartime hardships.**

**this might be used today to understand when the army is demoralized and 
when this army is ready to fight against it's own government**
