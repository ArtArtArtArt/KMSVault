It is good to learn the movies not from the oldest, but from the best today, and trace the heritage back.

*don't start with a theme - start with what inspires you. This also implies that you love stories not because of the themes, but stating the themes makes everything make sense.*

**Pick the ones that you like and expand on them**

[[2022-11-12]] "It is good to learn the movies not from the oldest, but from the best today, and trace the heritage back." - I really like this one - I think education should be built like this
Also the fact that thinking about music helps you elivate the theme of your story even if you do not know it yet. I also think that is why randomness might help you see deeper into the story - some random element may suddenly evoke strong emotions (projective practice - like taro) ^546351
