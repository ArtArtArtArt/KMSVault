Thoughts that help fighting the sensory hunger

- You and everyone else are okay
- Every action has a positive intention
- Every action is a best choice in current situation (you could not act differently - looks like a philosophy of determinism)
- You have all the resources to make your life better
- Positive change is inevitable
