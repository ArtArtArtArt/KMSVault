# RTS game loop problem
https://www.quora.com/Is-the-age-of-RTS-games-over?utm_source=pocket_mylist

RTS has a problematic gameloop
 - start might be superoptimized and requires zero on foot decision making
 - late game is predetermined rather early and you are slowly dragged to defeat (like in monopoly)

**what would be your ideal strategy? specially PVP**
