USSR was not anti racist:

November 2, 1917, the Bolsheviks issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, which promised the "abolition of any national and national-religious privileges and disabilities" and the "free development of national minorities,"

All 172 recognized ethnicities in russia were forcibly united into "russia"

Anti racism was targeted specifically on black people
African Americans who visited and immigrated to the USSR, such as Claude McKay, W. E. B. Du Bois, William L. Patterson, and Harry Haywood, whose image the party used, lived a much more comfortable life than the USSR's average residents.
While the country lived with an incredible deficit, the Black visitors received free housing, food, clothing, weekly allowances, and all-expense-paid vacations.

All this actions were surface level and were aimed to create an image of anti racism. USSR was deeply racist
 - Crimean Tatars. The entire ethnic Crimean Tatar population (at least ca. 200,000 people) was deported within two days in 1944. About 8,000 died during the deportation, and between 20% and 46.2% died in total.
 - North Caucasians. 478,000 people, of which 387,000 Chechens and 91,000 Ingush, were arrested and deported from the Caucasus to Central Asia in 1944. Between 30% and 50% of the deportees died during the journey of deportation and in the first years.
 - Kalmyks. In 1943, about 93,000 Kalmyks were deported to Siberia. Many of them died during the journey as well. Some who survived the journey died during the first glacial Siberian winter.
 - Koreans. 175,000 Koreans who lived along the Chinese and Korean borders were deported to Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR in 1937.
 - In the 1950s, Khrushchev rehabilitated most of the punished peoples, except for Crimean Tatars, Russian Germans, and Meskhetian Turks, who were essentialized as Nazi collaborators for decades after WWII.

*Portnikov says that USSR was anti-Semitic - he could not enter a university because of his heritage*


USSR had unwritten racial hierarchy https://t.co/brekZQApGq


The first, most important, are the Ethnic Russians, the Older Brother. Next, two more younger brothers: Belarusians and Ukrainians (‚Äúwhite russians‚Äù and ‚Äúlittle russians‚Äù). Three, the Baltic peoples: Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians.
Four, the Moldovans, nations of the Caucasus, the Georgians, Armenians, and Turkic Azeris. Five, less white and more ‚ÄòOrient-looking‚Äô Central Asians ‚Äî Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Turkmens, and Uzbeks.
Finally, The Tatars, Buryats, Dagestani, and others are at the bottom of the hierarchy. This is especially telling now that Buryats and Caucasians constitute the majority of known Russian war casualties.
They are still using Buriats as the lower class
