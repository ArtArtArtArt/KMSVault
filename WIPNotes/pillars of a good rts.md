Three pillars of good RTS:
 - The engine - it should be convenient to use
 - Spectacles - but hard to maintain in multiplayer, cool staff is hard to explain why
 - Dev Tools - editor helps to create new content and expand on things that happen to be great

Player created content is super important for the rts
People download more mods for rts then for supper successful non rts titles.

On of the best selling RPG games is Skyrim - had many mods
The most successfull HAlO is 3 - which had forge mechanic
KSP - super dependant on mods.
Minecraft - had many mods.

Roblocks is only a platform for game creation - is super top game.
People are very hungry on game creation platforms.


If a game is a creator platform - then more creation happens even after release, and then more players are attracted.



RTS is a real time sandbox - that is a formula of successfull rts.


*Not only victoria 3's mod will be the best paradox game, the next greatest game will be a mod*
