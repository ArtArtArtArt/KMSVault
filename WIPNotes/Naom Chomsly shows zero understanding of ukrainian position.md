Noam Chomsky says that Ukrainians arenâ€™t actually demanding heavy weapons, thatâ€™s just western propaganda.

Crazy how theoretic of propaganda fails to see through modern propaganda.

Or that guy is biased to attack America
[[leftists, antiamericanists, pacifists might be against Ukraine in this war]]

A lot of people might be more anti American then leftist or anti imperial
