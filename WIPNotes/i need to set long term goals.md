# i need to set long term goals

I want the job and the money
I want creative activity which will bring me most of the joy
I want other activities which will slowly create something else (Donald Glover style)

So I need to do planning for 5 years

Also I should try to write down what are the skills and intuition behind these goals.

I want the job and the money
	Skills - professional, ability to switch and learn, ability to change positions and jobs, good communication, connections in the industry, being able to organize my time so I can do 2 jobs at the same time? - skill be super provider for the family.
I want creative activity which will bring me most of the joy
	Skill of being attentive to myself, discipline and experience of showing my creations
I want other activities which will slowly create something else
	skill to have projects running in the background, skill of slowly finishing something that I have been returning back to for a while, experience of switching creative fields with some creations, skill of promoting the creations in different fields
