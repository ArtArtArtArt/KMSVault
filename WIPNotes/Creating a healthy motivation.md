1. Swap goals with skills. Have a list of your core skills that you care about and see if skills that this task gives you overlaps with your core value skills. *Also I feel that exact goal tend to demotivate if they are not achieved*
2. Meet your heroes - the skills that I think that are important to success in anything are very often different from what is necessary. So pay attention to people that have you want - what skills do they have? how can you develop them? This helps to have an answer - what are the skills which are needed to move the needle??? So you have to do at least something to move in skills that are important to succeed.
3. Strategic detachment. See your goal as a vehicle to improve skills that you care about. This helps to feel that you are not trapped - no dichotomy of doing/quitting. 
4. What instinct am I improving? Failure is a way to improve an instinct on failure. *This is a specific case of skill improving*. I am investing into more flow in future - because **better instinct means better flow**.
