Kierkegaard Years of life 1813-1855

Most notable works:
 - 1843 Either/Or
 - 1834 Fear And Trembling
 - 1849 The Sickness Into Death

Kierkegaard is born in Copenhagen
Kierkegaard is born to very wealthy family
His family had seven children, he was the youngest

By the time he was 22 all his siblings died except for he and his brother

In Either/Or Kierkegaard wants us to wake up and give up our cozy sentimental illusions (*both choices are regrettable*)
He attacked Danish haute bourgeoisie, and the members of the established Danish church for their way and view of life

He also attacked a new idea of passionate marriage - he thought you cannot have both at the same time - this idea camo of his own experience with  18-year-old girl, called Regine Olsen - with who he broke off the engagement when he realized that living with her meant killing the love that brought him to her

"Marry or don't merry - you will regret it too"


Kierkegaard is described as a founder of existentialism
His ideas were expanded by Sartre, Camus and Heidegger

"The concept of anxiety" 1844 fascinated existentialists the most
"The concept of anxiety" introduced a new concept called "Angst"
"Angst" is a condition where we understand how many choices we face,
and how little understanding we can ever have of how to exercise these choices wisely.
"Life can only be understood backwards but is lived forwards"

"it's not possible for anyone to be absolutely, and in every conceivable way, completely content,"
"not even for a single half hour of his life."

"No one has come into the world without crying. No one asks when you want to enter the world; no one asks when you want to leave."

Kierkegaard had an answer to angst - Jesus Christ
Kierkegaard loathed the Christianity of the established Danish church, but he adored the simple truths of the Gospels that his father taught him as a boy


Kierkegaard wasn't interested in justifying his attachment to Christianity through rational means; instead, he recommended a dramatic and now famous 'leap of faith' one would merely switch off one's faulty rational faculties, and jump into the idea of God as the total solution.

"To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God".



**Like Marxist communism, Kierkegaard's solutions to the problems of being human are far less convincing and interesting than the diagnoses of our ills**
