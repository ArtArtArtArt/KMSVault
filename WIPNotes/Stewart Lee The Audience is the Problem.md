Once poeple realize that their aaproval is irrelevant they often relax and give it to you

## [5:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=325)

Norm McDonald is the smartest person in the room pretending to be the dumbest

## [5:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=346)

I think I like stuart lee is becasue he is magifiing the egocentric narcissist that I feel is a big part of me
He states true struff but also redicules it

## [8:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=511)

Lee divides the audience and makes them compete
The problem is not lees ability to deliver a joke - but audiences ability to understand

Also lee said at the beginning that stand up can be anything - which I quite like

## [10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=657)

Lee relies on people understanding how this type of jokes work

## [11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=697)

He sabotages the jokes that works rather then finish it

## [12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=756)

Lee laughs at people laughing at simple jokes

## [14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=888)

Brechtian Alianation
I want you to laugh in spite of me not because of me

## [16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=998)

Hand signs to rob performance of spontaneity

## [18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=1100)

He wants people to see mechanics of his performance

And I like it very much - I seem to like learning the structure more then creativity itself - and I hate people despising structure

## [22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=1326)

it also feels extremely honest to tell the insides of the show immediately

## [24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=1464)

Lee wants people to admire the comedy rather then like him as a person

## [25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA&t=1534)

and at the end people will least expect something actually funny
