# tax the rich is a bad idea

Tax the rich

Taxing more the rich people does not make any sense.
If you a rich because you exploit the system - then the system should be fixed. Taking more money from the rich does not address the problem.
If you are rich honestly - then you are talented resource allocator, and you definitely should not be punished for that.
