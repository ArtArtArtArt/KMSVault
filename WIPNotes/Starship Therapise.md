> Starship Therapise explores the ways in which narratives and play inform the shape of our lives, inviting readers to embrace radical self-care with lessons from Ghost in the Shell, explore anxiety with Miyazaki, and understand narrative therapy with Arya Stark. Spanning fandom from Star Wars to Harry Potter, Zelda to Adventure Time, and everywhere in between, Starship Therapise is an invitation to explore mental health and emotional wellness without conforming to mainstream social constructions.  
  
>In the Starship Therapise book, authors Garski and Mastin dabble in a never ending exposition of how gaming culture and fanfiction are the new panacea of the psychological and medical cures.  
  
>This book is an amazing new look on narrative therapeutic practices, among others, and how to rewrite your life using your favorite characters as guides and inspirations. It encourages you to reconnect with play and creativity in whatever way makes sense for you.
