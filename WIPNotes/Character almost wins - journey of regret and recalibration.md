# Character almost wins - journey of regret and recalibration

Character can achieve all his dreams in an instant at the beginning of the story. But he fails and his jorney is extremely hard to get at least partially of what he could get.
Like out situation in Ukraine. We could enter NATO in 90th, but now it is something that we extremely require and it is very hard to implement now (but a bit easier due to event of 2022)
That almost winning at the begining and constant retracing of how easy everything could be if you did not make that mistake is very dramatic. It also deepense the understanding of how hard is his goal, and how non appreciating he was when he almost got it all.
