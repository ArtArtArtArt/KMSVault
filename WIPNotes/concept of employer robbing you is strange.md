How to know that employer is robbing you?

If you could earn more without the employer then employer is

But what if employer makes it harder for you to earn more? What if he is destroying competition of other employers?
Then he is robbing you too

Creating jobs for sake of creating jobs is easy - just dig holes

Government cannot create workplaces - it can only shuffle them
Every workplace created in government you lose a place in private sector

if employer is robbing you - start your own business and earn more
you can't? then there is no free market - fix the market

[[Free market optimizes benefit and is not suitable when the number of participants is needed to be regulated]]
