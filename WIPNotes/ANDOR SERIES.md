Shooting is meaningful
Death is meaningful
Empire is corrupt

Coruscant is like a new york

Everyone seem to have an ideology (the main white suit - treat the disease because security is an illusion)

Very cool depiction of colonialism - people hate authorities and have their own level of organization (hitting metal stuff - maybe inspired by some real behavior)


Also parallelism between small and adult andor's stories is awesome
Also droid which stutters - is an awesome detail


It is awesome that small problem with Andor escalated because if three ingredients - lazyness of main boss, overworking of a big officcer, and the desire to be cool of the operation lead


Personally I was not trusting the series until first payoffs
Then I got that I an in the good hands (as Tarantino says)


Impire looks like reich, but nehaves like deeply beurochractic maritime empire (something like the dutch or english or french empire)
Empire is not a monolith - it every character has it's own intensions


Theory - every character has a "but" in his first impression
Vel is the leader - but she is heavily influenced by Skarsgaard



Every new character has a link to what we already know
Nobody is presented out of the blue for us to hope that at some point the connection will be visible - it is visible outright
So it makes it easier to follow new characyers



Empire is shown to poses a lot of artiffacts of captured colonies

Also Tales of Jedi show that even republic can behave as a colonial power - and that basically transition to empire did not change fundamentally some things (super power of senators for on places for example)
Also double talk in the store of skar5sgaard and when Ahsoka and senator meet at padme's funeral

WTF why family drama of the senator is so well done..


First three episodes is a mafia movie in a corrupted gotham
next episodes seem to be a heist movie
