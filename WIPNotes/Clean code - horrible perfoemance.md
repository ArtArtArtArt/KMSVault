*My conclusion:
A switch, polymorphism and a table can be used for the same problems but have vary different performance metrics and open close principle following.
If I need an open closed high level solution for different behaviour of different objects I will use polymorphism
If performance is an issue - I will use switch statements
If I can see a way to use data table over almost similar algorithm - I will use that

*In order to have an opportunity to change between this approaches - I should always separate logically a polymorphic behaviour and an implementation.
