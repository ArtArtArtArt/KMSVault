To estimate an event try to add details and use bias theorem for calculating the chance
It is good for historical predictions

But it highly depends on amount of details that you want to provide - so better do it in comparison with some other events

Example
putin has mass shadow mobilization
putin does not have a mass shadow mobilization

and the observations that we had so far:
increase in numbers?

This can be broken further:
no increase in numbers
has increase in numbers

no visible increase in numbers stated by our side
