**Conclusion and Aftermath**

The war did not settle the relations of the powers in Eastern Europe, but it did change the alliances between them. The new Russian emperor Alexander II, who succeeded Nicholas I in March 1855, realized that he must radically reform the Russian state in order to compete successfully with the other European powers. Austria, having sided with Great Britain and France, was no longer allied with Russia and lost its support in central European affairs. Austria became dependent on Britain and France, which led to its defeat in two successive wars in 1859 and 1866 by Italy and Prussia. One could even argue that this dependence was the starting point of a chain of events that led to the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867 (more [here](https://www.byarcadia.org/post/the-austro-hungarian-compromise-of-1867)) and the decay of the Austrian prestige abroad. Metternich would certainly be very disappointed. The kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia found in Napoleon III and France the powerful ally it was looking for, to proceed with the unification of Italy. The French even helped the Italians militarily in their war against Austria in 1859. In this indirect way, the Crimean War of 1853-56 contributed to the unification of Italy and Germany (more [here](https://www.byarcadia.org/post/the-unification-of-germany)). Finally, the Greeks, although they did not take part in the war, lost the favor of the British and the French, because they tried to support Russia.
