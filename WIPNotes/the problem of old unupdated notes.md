# the problem of old unupdated notes

Maybe I have to come out with more aggressive evergreen note review.

```dialogue
<Maybe I should query something that was not updated for more than a month, and have a time where I review all this.

>But that will lead to overcrowd of your inbox

<Maybe then I do not need it. I will simply miss all those notes in the graph view by filtering to linkless notes. Also there is a proplem of having similar notes.
```
