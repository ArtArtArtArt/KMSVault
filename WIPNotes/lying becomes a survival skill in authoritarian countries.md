lying becomes a survival skill in authoritarian countries 
(Solzhenitsyn was saying the same thing about ussr)


if most of the people are lying it is really hard to now lie
because then you will probably loose your job and etc.

Imagine a game where behavioral patterns emerge in a society while you try to rule it
Later this will be able to bite you in the tale

falsehood also can lead to overestimating the success on the battlefield
because of compound falsehood (14:30)

23:10 there are a lot of math in war
you can calculate the best behavior based on previous exp and simulations 
this idea crumbles if input information is unreliable

25:15 - this fucks up echelon attacking too
 
23:00 - the more paper - the cleaner the ass - so a lot of lies creates a lot of alibi

Then infantry is attacking a fortified positions which (by papaer) should be destroyed - hence human wave for who knows what

51:00 excericises in belarus were not perfomred properly - otherwise russia would notice a lot of problems

Culture of desception is responsible that ruissians did not withdrawal thier gold reserves

This is not an issue of teh armies - but army is more vulnerale to it
SOme economic systems may live on lie for a very long time
