a-theism :
 - agnosticism (*but it might just be a different axis*)
 - athe-ism
 - verificationism (only things that can be verified are meaningful)

*I feel that I was close to verificationism - but now I feel that a lot of stuff which is important is only felt. *

**write more on phenomenologists
