# openworld is underutilized in many open world games

Often main quest of the open world game could just be a single player game.
Open-worldness is added as a trendy feature, not gameplay enhancement tool.
Mechanically they do not matter much.

Primary way for the player to engage with the world is to put mission markers far away in the world.
Problem - traversing the same areas gets boring quickly - hence fast travel and cinematic cameras of red dead redemption. 

Exploration is not a goal itself.

It is handled properly in new Zelda

You are presented with final boss right away and you are very weak.
The only way to improve yourself is to explore.
So players choose what they want to engage with in order to be prepared for the final task.
But in this way the game does not have a typical narrative.

How can we improve existing open world games to make them facilitate openworldness?

## Ghost of tsushima
task - gather strength and defeat the enemy
conquer the castle and become great warrior

BUT it has set amount of characters that you have to convince and nothing can change it.
And these characters do not do much.

If you enter the territory before gathering the allies you are prompted that there are overwhelming forces and you are killed. 

BUT
What if you could attack the castle at any point, but it would be really hard without allies.
*Also what if attacking the castle would make it stronger, so you will have to gather even more power*

## Far cry 5
Has a number of regions that has to be defeated (Like shadow of mordor) and a set of locations that you have to destroy
So almost all activities in the world contribute to the story.

## Red Dead redemption
Had a camp. If all missions could give you the opportunity to collect money for the camp it would be nice.
Economically money are underutilized in rdr

## Elden ring
Hard bosses to incentivize you to get good and come back.
So if you die, explore to get stronger and come back.


## God of War
Is linear but has exploration hubs - which is awesome.  Most open world games whould be good like that.

true open world is lego pieces.

*but what to do if someone on the internet has already came up with the perfect solution*

rdr has one foot in a open world design (moody cowboy simluation)
and one foot in the action roller coaster 


In rdr you had a map with the game, and if you turned off the radar you would be given directions by NPCs and by road signs.

RDR said to park carret is a secluded spot but it meant SPECIFIC secluded spot - so without map you could not find it.

If camp was a true incentive for a story progression than you would have to do bandit stuff in order to supply money.

Main missions give you way much money - no incentive to explore the world.


**what are your personal feelings about open world and crafting? what a game should look like to not fall pray of the "fashionable" gameplay choices?**
