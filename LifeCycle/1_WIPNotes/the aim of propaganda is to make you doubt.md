# the aim of propaganda is to make you doubt
The aim of the propaganda is not to make you have an opinion. It is for you to have doubts. It is almost impossible to destroy the doubt, but it is rather easy to destroy a strong opinion based on a fact. 
That is why russian propaganda does not generate a coherent story but rather ten different stories

**any additional talks/papers on goals of the propaganda? Young Naom Chomski maybe?**
