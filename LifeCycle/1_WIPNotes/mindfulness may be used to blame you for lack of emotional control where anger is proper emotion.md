[[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] defines mindfulness as “a way of being in a wise and purposeful relationship with one’s experience… cultivated by systematically exercising one’s capacity for paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally”

Critics of secular mindfulness often argue that it is influenced by Buddhism either too much or not enough.

According to _McMindfulness_, there are more than 100,000 books on Amazon with “mindfulness” or something similar in the title

"these superficial, gamified versions of mindfulness are a pale imitation of the real thing." - *Why gamification is bad?*

 A careful reading of Purser’s book suggests that he accepts that mindfulness-based interventions can help someone cope with chronic back pain, reduce the chance of a person with depression killing themselves, or make a vulnerable teenager less reactive


Californian guru Dawa Tarchin Phillips charges $12,000 for one day of corporate mindfulness training - but “Mindfulness is neither a quick fix nor simple… it is not about emptying the mind, not thinking, or turning away from experience… it is not attentional training that can be used for ethically questionable practice”

**perhaps I need some other review**
