No ludo narrative dissonance  
Death is a part of the world  
  
Mystery is your main driver - your curiousiry is what sets you up to an adventure  
  
No voice over - I did not even noticed


DLC
You think you are persuing secret codes - but in reality you are getting a deeper knowledge about the world


Good ideas
 - reuse of flashlight (to see and to activate mechanisms)
 - reuse of boats in the simulation (to move and to use glitch)
 - reuse of strangers fire (to light and for the glitch)


all the territories are reused based on new knowledge (lights, glithces, when you know how to light and blow fire etc)


You get used to flying to stranger - here it now becomes a location with a secret path
You are used to lanterns and where they lead - HERE ANOTHER TYPE OF LANTERN
