*this is filled mostly with my comments on points in the video*

 - work hard to get what you deserve. circumstances and luck play a huge role [[importance of luck in complex systems, influence of believing in luck on behavior]] overall life is unfair so there is no way that hard work will lead to success. It might very slightly increase the probability. And it works good in low competitive systems
 - you need a sick skin to succeed. if it is about vulnerability then this is straight up bad - no feedback loop is a sick skin. and it feels that better long-term strategy is antifragility [[happy life is antifragile life]] 
 - you should trust your instincts. brain is flawed, changing your mind is ok, following emotions is ok if you too if you notice the choice that you have beforehand
 - find your passion to be happy. but I believe that having multiple passions is ok  - so I will never stop on anything. Even more - not enforcing structure on your passions as long as possible is a good thing - and obsidian helps me a lot [[My knowledge and idea organization with Obsidian]] also we cannot be doing the same thing all the time - mostly we do not enjoy things that are repeated. Also **doing what you passionate about often feels bad in the process (14:30)**

[[2022-11-12]] if feels like the first advise is something that brought me personally a lot of inner piece and allowed space to just be playfull (which is ultimately what I want to be)
also this plays into having multiple passions - which I feel I need to be playful
overall all these advices are very strongly related to my self feeling
