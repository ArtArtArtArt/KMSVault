Every break up happens twice

first you break up with the person
then you break up with past yourself who had specific idea about that other person

it starts being hard when you have the first break up and hold on with the second one

Nostalgia - is worshipping the past because it is the past, something that we can ideolize
Melancholy - is when you hold on to your own loss, you are not charishing the past, you are charishing the loss, holding on to the pain of loss may be the way to have a little bit of that person. Because what you are really affraid of - is letting go of your pain.

So again - first you break up, then you have to break up with the break up
Melancholic is someone who confuses the pain with the sense of control (*kinda like a masochist?*)
