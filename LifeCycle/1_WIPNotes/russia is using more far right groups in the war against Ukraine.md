“Nazi,” when used by Russian officials, is simply a code-word to refer to anyone who opposes Russia’s barbaric war against Ukraine.

## Connections of russia to european noe nazis
Thulin, a Swedish citizen, was one of three men with a history in the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement who were convicted in 2017 of taking part in a bomb attack on a refugee center in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Swedish investigators discovered that Thulin and another accomplice had received weapons training in St. Petersburg from the Russian paramilitary group _Partizan_. _Partizan_ runs weapons-training courses on behalf of an ultranationalist organization called the Russian Imperial Movement, which has avidly supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The Russian Imperial Movement was previously designated by the U.S. Department of State as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization in April 2020 for providing training for acts of terrorism.

According to German media, several members of the German neo-Nazi groups _Third Way_ and _Young Nationalists_ likewise received training at _Partizan_’s camp near St. Petersburg.

In 2015, the United States sanctioned Dugin for “actively” recruiting “individuals with military and combat experience to fight on behalf of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.”

 Another Russian proliferator of virulent far-right, anti-Western propaganda is _Katehon_, a Moscow-based so-called “think-tank” with clear links to the Russian state and Russian intelligence services.

## All these movements are very linkes
These hateful far-right platforms are closely linked to each other, as well as to the Russian government.  Leonid Savin, the chief editor of _Geopolitica.ru_, is formerly _Katehon_’s chief editor and is reportedly a member of the Military-Scientific Society of the Russian Ministry of Defense.

 Dugin is an associate of _Katehon_’s sponsor, Konstantin Malofeyev, who also founded _Tsargrad TV_, which spews far-right disinformation.
According to media reports, Malofeyev has served as a proxy for Kremlin far-right influence operations in Europe, sponsoring meetings and conferences of ultra-conservative parties, as well as directly funding politicians and opinion makers who criticize liberal values and support the Kremlin’s policies.  The United States sanctioned Malofeyev in 2014 as “one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea” and for bankrolling “separatist activities in eastern Ukraine.”

Since February 2017, _Katehon_ has been headed by Mikhail Yakushev, whose career included stints at a foundation run by Vladimir Yakunin, a former KGB officer and former director of Russian Railways with close ties to the Kremlin.
