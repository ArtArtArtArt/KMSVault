# transfer burn plot device

Plotline like orbiting

To transfer to another orbit you have to make a small burn at a specific time while you are on a previous orbit. It will not look like a big change immediately but it will bring you to the goal inevitably.

Third episode of SW is like that - we know Luke is essential and it is pleasant to see him safe on Tatooine
The same with John Connor from the Terminator
