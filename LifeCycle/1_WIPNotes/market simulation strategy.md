# market simulation strategy

**what are the pillars and what exactly is interesting there for me?**
**can I suggest such a model that would work even in the prehistoric times up until the 19th century with it's banking system???**

world is a market
you consume what you produce
swapping is introduced
price is currency + amount

every person has needs and production

production can be organized in different ways

production takes resources and uses organization to produce

## Production
Every participant of the organization is contributing to production 


# Entities
 - Actors
 - Resources
 - Values
 - Knowledge

## Problems and decisions:

 - Calculating every single person is expensive. 
	 - I do not want to simulate every single person - I will simulate entire communities and based on their parameters I will calculate the output. Community is a group of people sharing the same culture (set of memes)

 - What to do with birth and death? Where exactly to add or substract?
	 - Add/Subtract from communities AND organizations

 - What if some organizations are composed of several communities?
	 - maybe I need a new entity - organization - which will be handled differently and will influence all communities according to how many of their representatives are inside the organization

 - But people may transition from one community to another. They might adapt part of foreign memes and become something transitional 
	 - A community might have a parameter of what deviations it has - and how many of them there are - and create a separate community only when a deviation is strong enough

**expand on what are these concepts comprise of **
