# I like transferability in a strategy
I want a strategy game to be able to transfer to a story, and I want a real story to transfer to a strategy. That is the highest quality for me.
I also think that of not every real story can be transferred - it is still good.

So I like games that generate stories?

*If this is goal - then why don't you start with the idea what is a story and then build a game that creates all the narrative elements that you need - like character arcs?*
