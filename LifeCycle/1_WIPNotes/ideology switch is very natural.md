Germany has switch ideology 5 times during 100 years (1890-1990)
These were the same people and they truly believed in the stories they lived by.
That is an important feature of the humankind - ideology dies before the human

On the other hand germans did not really switched ideaologies after ww2 - at least the ones who witnessed nazi germany 
[[German guilt was absent even in 1951]]
