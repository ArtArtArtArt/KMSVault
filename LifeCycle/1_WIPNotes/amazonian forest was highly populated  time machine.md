20 million people live in the amazon

They used artificial soil - Terra Preta

It is a high chance of much higher development in the amazon

We do not have a full picture of how developed the Americas were 
[[2022-11-12]] *I also remember that western americans had stone fortresses before the european comming + the fact that most of the american population presumably died of illnesses*  

**check if scientists agree on that**

**this can be used for the game - the size the civilizations live away**

*also if we travelled in time backward we would probably kill people of the past with disease that we have immune system for. That is why if the machine existed we would not try to use it to travel to the past (maybe only with costumes???) Moreover if someone had travelled and changed past we would only knew that he did it - we would never understand what exactly did he change, and if he overwritten some other people that has used the time machine*
