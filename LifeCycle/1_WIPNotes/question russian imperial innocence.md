# question russian imperial innocence

Russia is both victimized by the West and entitled to regional dominance in the former Soviet territories

putin really tries to control russian informational state but people still have access to facebook instagram twitter - they just mostly choose to ignore other position

somehow russian intellectuals were not focused on imperial colonial state of russia either

today russia is constantly condemning prioritization of indigenous languages as attempts to limit the rights of the ethnic russian population in former soviet republics (https://kaktus.media/doc/449941_kak_zakon_o_gosiazyke_povliiaet_na_prava_rysskoiazychnyh_grajdan_mnenie_posla_rossii.html)
Do basically **disagreement with russian imperial greatness is viewed as attack on russian culture**

russian imperial myth allows militant mobilization if needed AND passive and uncritical public

putin renewed stalins myth that russian people are destinied to balance against western imperialism

Russian academia views bolsheviks as someone who brought modernity and not colonialism (https://eurasianet.org/russias-colonial-allergy)
russian racism prevents from seeing russia as a colonial power [[USSR was not antiracist - it was extremely discriminative]]


And then critiques of stalin does not need 
Solzhenitsyn critiques stalin but still is an imperialist - calling for annexation of northern kazakhstan and denied ukrainian independence
Brodsky is not recognizing ukraine too

In central asia russian state regularly interveens in schooling process (https://twitter.com/rusembkg/status/1513795815898288129?s=21)

In Ukraine and Kazakhstan people are noticing the unimaginable cost of soviet regime because of artificial Holodomor
Georgia(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13688790.2019.1690762) and Kyrgyastan (https://kloop.kg/blog/2020/10/21/bezhali-ot-pul-i-umirali-ot-pogodnyh-uslovij-na-issyk-kule-ustanovili-installyatsiyu-v-pamyat-o-zhertvah-vosstaniya-1916-goda/) are reexamining the purges.

Russian altruistic reputation is under big question considering war in Ukraine. 
Russia is not sacrigficing itself for non russian republics
soviet regime is not a gift of modernity - it is a brutal colonizer.

[[russian liberals are the enemies of tomorrow]]
**it is not enough to condemn tsar, stalin or putin.  Accept responsibility for historical crimes, and accept modern racist colonial nature of russia.
