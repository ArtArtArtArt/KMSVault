# how to expand evergreen notes regularly

I almost never get to the 4th point where I expand evergreen notes. That has to be fixed.

one of the way is making compulsory to expand evergreen notes at first and then try to zero out.

maybe I have to trust myself and zero out often to just go to evergreen.

also maybe I should move more of the inboxes stuff to the trash (for example at least 1/3 of all)

I think I will try writing evergreen notes first.
