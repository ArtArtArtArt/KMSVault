I remember during LCD trip on Natura that I was dissociating.
Suddenly you do not remember living last 10 seconds. 
You may remember what you were doing or saying but you do not remember *living* those seconds of your life.
It implies that there is something else happening besides the actual actions during your life which determines it you are feeling like you are living right now.

And I claim that this something is watching yourself from the outside.

In this case listening to music is helping you to feel that you are living your life as it helps you to feel that you are outside watching yourself. See [[music does not help you to connect to your emotions]].

Zizek says something similar about sex. He says that pleasure from sex comes precisely from the fact that there is someone else watching you. It may be you yourself from past or future, but you have to observe yourself from the outside at one moment, to truly appreciate what is happening.
