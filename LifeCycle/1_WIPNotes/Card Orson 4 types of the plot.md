Card Orson 4 types of the plot
**milieu, idea, character, and event**.


The milieu is the worldâ€”the planet, the society, the weather, the family, all the elements that come up during your world-creation phase.Â Every story has a milieu, but when a story is structured around one, the milieu is the thing the storyteller cares about most. (_Gulliverâ€™s Travels_)

Idea stories are about the process of seeking and discovering new information through the eyes of characters who are driven to make the discoveries. The structure is very simple: The idea story begins by raising a question; it ends when the question is answered.(*detective stories*)

Character stories focus on the transformation of a characterâ€™s role in the communities that matter most to him. (*Indiana Johns is not character story - he does not change*)

In the event story, something is wrong in the fabric of the universe; the world is out of order (*appearance of a monster*)
