# Needless pursuit

Sometimes I am pursuing the girl which is clearly not interested. Feels like I am closing my gut feeling on social cues at that moment. I think this happens as a distraction from not getting what I really want - and it is very important to try to understand what is standing behind. ![[understanding somethins leads to release in tension]]
Also it is interesting to notice why am I choosing this strategy of almost certain rejection to anything else. Is there something magnetic, convenient or familiar in a situation like this?
