# strategy of important people

You cannot simply do the actions
You can do something if this is in character of the one that you control, or you can introduce a new character. *creates tension because you cannot simply do what you need to do - but maybe collecting the team would be interesting thing*

So invention - is some real people who drive it forward.
New law - is some real people who are activists.

And you spend mana to activate those characters. And you spend less mana if you want them to do what is in their character. You also get specific life events for them which may make them stronger or weaker or destroy them.
You can spend mana to force some character to do what is out of his character - but this means that some life event forces him to.

So you guide your nation through great people's hands.

To create an important character - you try creating the environment for them.

At the end - you have a grand narrative of great people that lead your nation to success.

Also characters may change and collide with each other.


For example:

You want to build a factory.
Your emperor is not interested in building and industrialization.
So you may create a new friend which will make emperor like these things.
Or you can create a government official who will be fighting for that.
Or enthusiast who will try to do it (with lower probability).


Giving a friend to the emperor changes him for a long time, but makes building cheaper. And in the long run it will be more difficult to make him do something else.
