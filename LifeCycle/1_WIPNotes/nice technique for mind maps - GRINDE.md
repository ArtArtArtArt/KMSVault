# nice technique for mind maps - GRINDE

GRINDE

Grouped - group as early as possible
Reflective - put what is on your mind on paper
Interconnected - make sure you notice as much connections as possible between the concepts
Non-verbal - shorten sentences - or even use pictures - helps reducing cognitive load on instruments (and use it for learning itself)
Directional - use arrows to show cause and effect relations - helps encoding
Emphasized - highlight stuff which is important - again reduces cognitive load on instrument
