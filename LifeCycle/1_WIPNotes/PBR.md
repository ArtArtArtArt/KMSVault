# PBR
Rendering approach that seeks the simluation of physical light. It uses bidirectional reflectance distribution faction [[BRDF]] and [[Render equation]].

This approach came to life after usage of certain models of illumination (diffuse, specular lighting, etc.)

PBR is orthogonal to [[raytracing]]. Both approaches may be used together.


Also there is non physical rendering
