Luck is responsible for 90 percent of top tear people if we try to simulate like in the video (luck is 5 percent success)

Luck might be not so important for the middle strata - but still is present. **What is it exactly? Try testing with an app** 

*I tested it and I saw that 90 percent of the top people change places, and ~1 stops being in the top 10. So the difference is not so drastical (but I used top 8). If luck is closer to 50% then approx 50 percennt of top ten changes.*

Thinking that luck does not matter - you become more motivated and hardworking
Thinking luck matters - you become more humble and helpful
(also study shown in video)

It feels like luck is more apparent to unlucky.
Egocentric bias helps here too.
