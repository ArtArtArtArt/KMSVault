This war is generational - average age for people in power in Ukraine is 44,7 in russia 63,4


Putin has been extending the age laws in order to have the same people around.
So called courtiers.
And the barons (goreners) are younger because they are rotated more because they are not so important.
The elite age now is of the breznev era. But still younger then american elites.

This gerontocratic regimes are very unstable when life of all the leaders start coming to end.
In USSR is was called carriage races - people joked about who will die first.

A narrow clique takes power and does not allow anyone up. But they are mortal and when they die a strong crisis starts.
Avoiding small risks by not swapping the elite russia generates even stronger risks in the future.

**The average age among the leadership of Russiaâ€™s highest bodies of legislative and executive power is currently 55 years old.**Â This is slightly lower than the average under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev (55.9 years old),

**does it mean that russia will not survive for long? how does it influence us?**
