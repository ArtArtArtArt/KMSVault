Karl Marx was writing degrading things about russia - so some parts of his work were not published there

Only the suitable stuff was in the focus

As with colonial communists (like Viet Con)
They focused on anticolonial parts of marx, but USSR practically ignored it

Also add note here that Marx was super popular in russia even before he was popular in Germany. Something about his ideas stroke deeply with russian imperial culture 
[[russian culture is not spiritual and mystic - it is utilitarian and has high demand for theory-for-everything#^d16782]]
