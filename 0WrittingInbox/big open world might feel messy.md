Open world games might feel small because of bad utilization of space and repetition

*I also find it hard to feel that the world is big if I cannot orient myself in it - that is why lego lord of the rings map (I am familiar with it, it is very filled with landmarks) feels big and lego star wars (which is much bigger world on paper) feels messy.
These bad big worlds do not feel small, but they do not feel big, they feel messy.

*The WOW world felt very big because bioms were very special, unrepetitive and small. They also had stories inside them and you could actually experience the change of the environment because of your actions.*

This video also suggests games that do it right:
 - A short hike (1 hour)
 - Pathless (7 hours)
 - Elba (3 hours)
 - Bouzers Fury (5 hours)

Why author did not like ghost of tsushima?
 - it repeats itself *it almost feels that repetition adds size on paper but not in the feelings way*, players wants to pursuit unique stuff more. 
 - the rewards were not something that you care about (specially when you progress further into the main quest)
 - you do not know what is worth your time - so many side quests just overwhelm you and make you  
 - small maps make you more familiar with the map that you are exploring - and that way you do not need a marker following gameplay
 - small maps remove the need to be walking for a long time (which is not exciting). in pathless you have to shoot targets to increase the dash meter - which helps to make movement more exciting. In bouzers fury you explore small islands and moving between them is fun because you swim on a fast beast + have random encounters in between
 - Reuse of space using changing conditions. in Bouzers fury the bouzer might randomly attack which changes the way you use environment and males it more interesting to interact. In pathless a red cloud might appear, and you will be separated from your eagle companion and you have to be stealthy (using environment differently - recontextualizing it). In elba it is done changing the time of the day - which changes the environment and makes it more alive - and each day a new mechanic is introduced

So world feels bigger if you explore (not move after the marker) and you engage with everything (not picking weather it is worth your time)
