# use system instead of the goal
https://www.tiktok.com/@yulya_yulaaa/video/7110616307845876997?_t=8TIFdCqfaNh&_r=1
system is a set of measures that you do 

*goal is something that might or might not be achieved

*by participating in system you move towards the goal - and thus the goal itself might change 
But the system will follow - if you notice that you do not act upon it anymore

System is often a more healthy way to interact with the world
