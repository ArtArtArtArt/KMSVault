Modern russian military complex depends on tools.
And russia tried to create them on their own - but failed.
Many military plant producers simply bought european and passed it as russian.
Although it was covered in media - no real consiquences
But for buying chineese and passing it as russian they had real criminal punishments - for "fraud"

Galeev makes an assumption that it is "allowed" to fraud the european tools but not for chineese
russians might have thought that chineese risks are unmanageable - unlike european. They saw Europe as divided so it can be used as a source for tools.
But as we can see in 2022 they were really wrong.
