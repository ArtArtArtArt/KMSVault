https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial

There are still existent holocaust deniers
They either say it is staged or say that their nation did not take part in extermination

Deniers are separated from the revisionists - who also try to rediscover history and are usually concerned about consequences of the facts then the facts themselves.

Denial of the genocide is often a part of it. It is shown in a form of paraphrasing the actions. 
[[Lawrence Douglas]] says that nazi tried to persuade people that gas chambers where just showers.
Also he says that the cars that transported people where labeled with the red cross and people where told that they where resettled.

## Holocaust deniers fathers

# [[Maurice Bardèche]]
 - testimonies are not reliable, essentially coming from the mouth of Jews and communists
 - atrocities committed in camps were the fact of deportees essentially the [kapos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapo_(concentration_camp) "Kapo (concentration camp)"
 - disorganization occurred in Nazi camps following the first German defeats
 - the high mortality is due to the 'weakening' of prisoners and epidemics

## [[Harry Elmer Barnes]]
 - the "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the "scapegoat" for their own misdeeds
