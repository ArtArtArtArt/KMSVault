# imposter syndrome

[https://youtu.be/6lXopPeqiBM](https://youtu.be/6lXopPeqiBM)  
  
Every man is an actor of his ideal - nizshe  
  
Imposter adaptation - no mater how many times you disproof your lack of self belief - it still persists  
  
With age people become more agreeable consciences and less neuroticism  
  
You get more confident if you voluntarily expose yourself and if other people remind you of your achievements
