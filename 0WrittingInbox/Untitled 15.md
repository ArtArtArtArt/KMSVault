How to make villain project power in the beginning but not kill a protagonist.
 - calm in a dangerous situation (Joker, Vader)
 - show intellectual power (hannibal lector, Hans Lando (inglorious bustards))
 - do not show the villain. Villain does not see protagonist as a threat (avatar and firelord)
 - have them murder everyone - nuclear option :)
