free market optimizes benefit (for buyers and sellers at the same time).
It needs preconditions and it might regulate amount of participants (due to competition or inability to meet the price)
but what happens when creativity is also a free market?
Does a creator have to optimize for benefit? then what benefit should he optimize for? is emotional connection a benefit?
does a creator feed of emotional connection too? who is seller and who is buyer here?
why should money play any role in it?
