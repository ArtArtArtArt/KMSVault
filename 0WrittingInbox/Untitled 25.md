Ignore
 - strict schedules do not work in a long run for most people.  
 - notifications on phone do not work either

what may help
 - imagine every step in details of what you have to do in order to make actions of the habit - which will reduce the resistance of doing it all in the future - also you can do this if you are skipping something - that would still reinforce the habit *this is a nice exercise*
 - plan in phases not in hours - harder to fail, clearer goals [[day schedule for me]] ^37becc
