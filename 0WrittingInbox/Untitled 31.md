Look whom the Western media are quoting and interviewing. Almost always it will be the representatives of a closely interconnected political&media ecosystem of Moscow tusovochka. Those who work in the province get almost zero coverage no matter how much they are doing

Why do Westerners give voice only to the Moscow tusovochka? My guess: 1. It's easy 2. It's pleasant. Tusovochka usually has that social polish that will make Westerners feel good. And feeling good is the priority here 2. They think they can add some positive knowledge this way

Giving additional platform and additional representation to the already wildly overrepresented Moscow establishment skewes the already existing bias even further. You are not helping, you are making things worse. Just stop it

Instead of quoting the Moscow media how about quoting the regional ones such as 77? Instead of quoting the Moscow politicians and activists how about quoting the regional ones which currently have almost no voice and no representation in the West at all? End of thread

PS Moscow's domination over the regions is not "natural". It's constructed. And its key element is the cultural hegemony which largely results from Moscow being almost the sole intermediary with the West (with the single exception of StP). This cycle must be broken


*most opf the western media talk only to moscow medias and personalities - when they should also consider communication with all other parts of the russia*
