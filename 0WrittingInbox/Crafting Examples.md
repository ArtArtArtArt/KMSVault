 - _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance/Radiant Dawn_ - Crafting as character investment.  Crafting of weapons breaks weapon triangle that dictates how to fight and creates persionalization.
 - _Resident Evil 4, Alone in the Dark_, and _The Last of Us_: Crafting to beat back the darkness.  Control the tension by adjusting accessability of stuff used to survive.
 -  _World of Warcraft_: Crafting to define social roles. Based on recipes.  Professions mean that no one create everything - so cooperation is imbedded in crafting system. Profession pick based on usefulness or blindly based on economy.  Quest creation should be taken into account - as it should not inshadow the crafting.
 - _The Witcher_: Crafting as aesthetics and ritual. The craft might require in game time, time of the day may impact the outcome. So it is more then a variable.
 -  _Eve Online_: Capitalism ho! Capital ship creation requires immense cooperation - it is a major driving force for the game. Crafting in game items is so expensive that no single player can hope to acquire all ingredients. Player decisions lead to organization of social physical and resource power across different  geographic sectors of the game.
 - _Pokemon_: Disguise your crafting system. Pokemon is a weapon and you choose what you take with you in your 6 slot invertory.
 - Minecraft:The tip of a very large iceberg.  Shape based UI to communicate how to craft. The system is created to not have recipes at the beginning. Crafting is a puzzle that you have to figure out.
