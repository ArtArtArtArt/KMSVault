# Untitled 4

For the lyrics to have an impact - have a twist in each of the verse - so the chorus feels fresh

Doja Cat - Woman 
Seems very traditional woman - but is strong on the inside in verse - so it feels very different when in chorus she still says that she want to be your woman - not like the first chorus - were she just feels submissive (I might have gotten the lyrics wrongly)
