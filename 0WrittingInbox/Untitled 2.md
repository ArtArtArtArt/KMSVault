angst - anxiety and dread

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkby8bl8yE&ab_channel=PursuitofWonder

[[Kierkegaard]]:

the feeling of freedom and responsibility
is a dizziness of freedom

we do things to prevent anxiety - but anxiety is constant

response to anxiety is a difference of living fully or desperate

passion is an antidot to angst
living to the personal truth
other stuff is escapism
