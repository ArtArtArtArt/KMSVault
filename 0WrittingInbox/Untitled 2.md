Russia has threatened Finland multiple times 

1. Cutting electricity exports as of today No problem, thanks to a new nuclear power plant + wind power Finland will soon be self-sufficient and even a net exporter. Finland used to import ~10% from Russia. Sweden & the Baltics can compensate for any short-term shortages.
2. Cutting gas deliveries (will prob happen this month) A bit annoying because some industries need gas but on the whole no problem because gas is only ~5% of Finland’s energy mix. Finland already works with Estonia on the purchase of a LNG terminal ship.
3. Ending the lease contract of the Saimaa canal (Finland has leased the part of the canal that runs through Russia) Finland doesn’t really need it anyways & would end up saving a s*it ton of money from the modernisation of the infrastructure.
4. Stationing troops at the Finnish border Currently the question is: what troops In the long term expected to happen anyways, regardless of whether Finland is in NATO or not. Russia already declared Finland an enemy along with the other EU countries.


"When I say Finland is prepared, I mean it. Russia has never NOT been THE security issue No. 1 for Finland. Although the world only recently found out about our 1340km border with Russia, we never once forgot about it. So rest assured, WE HAVE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH"
