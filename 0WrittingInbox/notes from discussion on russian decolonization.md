Russia is erasing cultures - on the political level

West had a lot of sympathy for the ussr - so they were not paying much attention to colonizers' practices in ussr

Global south is still sympathetic to russia - despite russia being crazy racist (people of color were excluded from soviet space)

West is responsible for colonization but at least it is widely discussing the issue
