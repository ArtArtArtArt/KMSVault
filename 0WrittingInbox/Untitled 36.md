A package delivers and maintains new software for Linux OS.
They govern addition, maintenance and removal of programs.

Linux users use different kernels so we cannot guarantee that a Linux program will be the same. So package include a manifest of dependencies for each kernel.

To download a package you have to use a package management system.

some alternativesa are
