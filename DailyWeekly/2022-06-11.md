Anything from ?![[weekly#Retro]]^000001


Working all day on the obsidian feels good, but I am very tired. Also there are too many links - I have to be more selective. But on the other hand - I am living through important events - maybe I should be noticing a lot?
Walking with KUM in the park really made me feel better
