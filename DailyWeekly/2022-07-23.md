## Rhythm
 - [ ] wake up your body (cold shower + maybe sports)
 - [ ] wake up your mind (obsidian + side projects)
 - [ ] prepare for the day (meals?)
 - [ ] mission of the day (job or obsidian)
 - [ ] recover from the mission (what good activity are you looking into?)
 - [ ] connect (check social media, maybe meet someone)
 - [ ] wind down (write about the day, meditate?)
 - [ ] rest (with eye shields)
