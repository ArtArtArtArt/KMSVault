# ROUTINE
0. **Read books** list if it is not empty.
1. **Move from *Google keep*, *YiNote*, *Pocket***, ***Youtube Watch laterList*** your last notes to the Writting box
2. Randomly **go through the WrittingBox**, try to zero out everrything that is a week old. If you move to evergreen try to come up with tags and a title
3. **Review and expand randomly** some evergreen notes. If you feel that you may come up with better name or tag - do change name and or add only tag - try to not remove tags. Also if you feel that some outline might be created - do it.
4. **Review the outlines** - maybe some of them might be ready for being promoted to PROJECT
5. **Review projects**. Create a project if needed with a README file.
6. **Remove notes from ZZZ** that are more then a week old.
7.  In the evening **go through your Reading Inbox**

There are several input sources that I have

 - Goolge keep notes with something that I watched on the phone
 - Yinote outlines of videos
 - Pocket sources that I have to work through
 - Youtube watch later

The question is - when should I clean them up? Maybe once per week?  -it happens naturally so it's ok - you do not start working on evergreen if you have not cleaned lists
