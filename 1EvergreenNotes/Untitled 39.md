As Mongols cannot be called a part of our culture - russian cannot be either.
Someone says that we do not have our own culture - even if so we will start creating it. 
Russian is still foreign and there is no reason to look at them differently.
No reason for example to call a street after russian poet or political figure unless he really influenced Ukraine.
No reason to have a monument to anyone who was not influencing the idea of Ukrainian state if it is financed by government. 
We also have our list of feigners who ruled this country - we should not have any monuments to them either.
