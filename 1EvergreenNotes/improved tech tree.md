# improved tech tree
How can tech tree for the war be fixed?

 - The tech by itself is not so useful except for the experience of usage + doctrine changes + supporting tech (synergical)
 - There are alternative paths and which path is developed is determined by what was picked by other people

So for example we have
Someone has developed X branch. To counter it other countries have to either develop X for symmetrical response or to develop Y for assymetrical response.

So any tech has a set of assymetrical responses.

Also some random techs have boosts with each restart - so you do not know which is meta for specific playthrough - so research is important to do.

Maybe we do not have asymetrical set per se. Every tech gives a set of bonuses and also debufs for the enemy. So you "responce" might be taking the same bonuses - or debuffing them from the enemy
