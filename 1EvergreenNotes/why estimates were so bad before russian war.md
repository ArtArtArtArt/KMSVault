1. Why was the Russian army so much overrated? 
2. Why was the Ukrainian army so much underrated?

Someone predicted the hollowness of the russian army accurately (https://t.co/b7G4AUnd5n) but mostly nobody saw what was coming. It said that russian army is artillery and air based - which is very hungry on resources. Supply lines depend heavily on railway, which is fragile and not flexible.
So proper counter tactic is to retreat, draw russians further from supply depot and then hit.

In order to make an analysis and prediction we have to look at the artifact.
Artifact can be view as a 
 - myth (something the creator of the artifact wanted to tell us)
 - remnant (something they did not intend to tell us but still did)
The same artifact might have both this parts in it.

This is a classification of the history primary sources by Lappo-Danilevsky.
Let's say a chronicle narrative about a military expedition is a myth. But the account journals from the same expedition would be remnants


High quality info might not be available if powerful actors do not want it to be available. 
In this cases the algorithm should be the following:
1) take lots of pieces absolutely available data 
2) use them as sources-remnants (look at what they did *not* want to say, but still did) 
3) aggregate


To start research projects like this you have to ask proper question, to ask a proper question you have to know half the answer. This is a Vershinin's approach. 
And for this method to work you need to leave out your memes. You might try to understand the reasoning of a very different value-wise people.

It is important to understand that different institutional cultures use different sets of instruments, based on different sets of assumptions.
*and we do not necessarily know the tools*

"I am pretty sure that the American expert community misjudges the Russian intellectual culture."

Many phenomena of an alien culture sound incredibly dumb when put out of context. And that's why they are ignored. Discussing something truly dumb or even worse studying it professionally, you may lose your status. And dumb here means = decontextualised

***Dump always mean decontextualized***

That creates a huge bias towards everything high-brow across areas studies. And the "high-brow" would mean: "something recognisable and relatable to sweet ourselves". Everything unrelatable (=truly specific to the culture) gonna be ignored. I see it often in the Russian studies



Failure to grasp the hollowness of the Russian military largely resulted from the over concentration on its "hardware". Which is objective, quantifiable, verifiable. Hardware-focused studies sound less objectionable and thus are incentivised under the vetocracy
Much less focus was made on the "software" of the Russian military. Its institutional culture (which is now *shockingly* anti-intellectual), its internal system of incentives, its role within the broader socio-political system. Its relations with other agencies (FSB, FSO)

Interestingly enough, in the past US military used to be interested in such software-focused, culture-specific, remnants-based studies. Consider The Harvard Project on the Soviet Social System Online commissioned by the US Airforce in 1950 https://t.co/8G3j3CwDEv
Within the Harvard Project they interviewed over 700 refugees from the USSR to paint a broader picture of the Soviet society. And they treated the testimonies as remnants. What impressed me when studying this project, was its remnants-perspective and the lack of wishful thinking
Unbelievably it may sound, they fooled no one. The manual explicitly stated that refugees "may distort their answers in order to tell Americans what they think Americans want to hear" partially from desire for approval, partially to increase their chances in the non-Soviet world
Let me give you some quotes to illustrate the manual's general attitude. Here for example they correctly mention that the refugees may fear to disclose both their pro-Communist (black spot for immigration security) and anti-Communist (aren't you a fascist?) activities
The manual argues that the differences between the American and the Soviet system are so great, that you can't judge the plausibility of information you are getting based on your "common sense". Sounds good, doesn't work. Many unbelievable stories were later proven very plausible
Most importantly. An interviewee is not your projection. It's not an anti-American who should put you on guard but rather the one "who comes up with an air-tight story and appears to be completely and unequivocally sympathetic to the Western point of view". That is very unnatural
Once again, US interviewers of 1950 didn't perceive interviewees as their projections. They realised they're members of another culture with different experience and perspective. If they're too pro-Western and their stories make too much sense, that should alarm the interviewer
Whereas most interviewees criticised the Soviet regime and often painted a picture of a purely violence-driven system which has little or no popular support, the study concluded that Stalin's regime has a wide popular support in the USSR. They treated testimonies as remnants

Whereas the capacities of the Russian army had been hugely exaggerated, the capacities of the Ukrainian one had been just as hugely underrated. Why? Well, once again, they missed the "software" aspect of the Ukrainian military. Culture, values, incentives. Identity


What he didn't realise however was that the Russian-ruled Donbass would become the showcase of the "Russian world" in the eyes of Ukrainians. In 2014 many believed that Russian rule could bring some benefits. By 2022 nobody believed that except for some geriatric pensionaries

This change of software heavily impacted the "hardware" aspect of the war such as its logistics. Wild stories about Russian columns being stuck in the Ukrainian fields with no fuel make more sense, if we consider that they expected the locals to supply them with it. Surprise
