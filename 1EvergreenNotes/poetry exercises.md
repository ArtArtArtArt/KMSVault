	 - Flash cards. Ten cards with different lines about one topic. Emotion, concrete detail anything. Then take only five of them - what kind of story is this?
	 - Eavesdrop. Write other peoples words in a notebook. At the end of the day analyze not what is written, but what does saying these words tell us about the talkers? Also incorporate peoples way of talking and rhythm.

	 - Free write. Ten minutes write without your hands leaving the keyboard or pen.
