# cross product



Is a determinant of a matrix created by two vectors

Cross product of 3D vectors is a vector

In 2D the result is a scalar. Right hand cross product will be negative and lefthand cross product is positive.
Right hand side is the fact that the first vector component will be on the left.

Cross product is 0 when two vectors are aligned or facing different directions.
