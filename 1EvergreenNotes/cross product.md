# cross product

Is a determinant of a matrix created by two vectors

Cross product of 3D vectors is a vector

In 2D the result is a scalar. Right hand cross product will be negative and left-hand cross product is positive.
Right hand side is the fact that the first vector component will be on the left.

Cross product is 0 when two vectors are aligned or facing different directions.
