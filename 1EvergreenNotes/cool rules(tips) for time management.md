## 3 way split
Every day this will happen:

1) High energy, high temptation activities
2) High energy, low temptation
3) Low energy, low temptation

## Mission impossible rule

Our brain tends to be occupied by the task until we finish it

So having a project name in a timeline even without actually doing it helps you pay attention to it in a sort of background fashion.
Using calendar more as an inspiration then a strict guideline is less stressful and more effective (because background thinking)

Put things into calendar knowing that this is mission impossible.

And do not force yourself into doing and finishing everything (*it is very pretentious to think that you know what you want. Just do what feels like, listen to your own reactions and emotions and let them guide you.*)

## PR Law

Work expands to fill the time we allocate to it.
Strict and ridiculous deadlines might help things fast.

*So allow yourself to fail in an impossible deadline, but still have it to unlock your "creative" approach to the task*

If you have a big task and break it into subtasks and fill your calendar with them - then you will almost certainly fail. 
So sometimes it is useful not to break the task but to force yourself into the small deadline. Gives positive pressure and freedom.

## Morning Glory
Start your day with something that you look forward.
**What is it for you?**

## Fun Factor
Self imposed work that I have to do might have a negative impact in the long term
  
Book fun time for yourself!

## Strategic overscheduling
Use calendar to fill in TODOs - just to remember about them.
