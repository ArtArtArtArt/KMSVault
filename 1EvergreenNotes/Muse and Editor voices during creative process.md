# Muse and Editor voices during creative process
https://www.tiktok.com/@thevelvetyear/video/7108222630213291310?_t=8T9hYfsH6Tm&_r=1

when you are creating art - you have two voices in your head
 - creative (muse)
 - critical (editor)

and critical or muse might get tired - and you will hear only one of them

hearing only one of them leads to bad creative results - or you do not see that what is coming out is not what you intended (only muse), or you do not see where to evolve it further (only editor)
