# perception of a character inside and outside the storyline is different

#plotline/theory

We do not perceive Orlando's character as next Davy Johns. And it is strange that we remain on William Turner. That twist at the end is not a part of his story. 
If this story is told to anyone else then it is a story of a new Davy Johns.
