# war doctrine in a game

You not only have to invent and produce but you have to use in real battle in order to come up with real doctrines


Also doctrines are born out of what does an enemy have

So some relation graph should be built

What about having these parameters for tactics:

Attack - rate, accuracy, piercing, area of effect
Defense - armor, concielment
Spotting
Chain of command
Logistics

Techs can boost this params
Also tactics can boost them


**Try to expand these parameters and explain the following technologies with tactics:
 - pre horse battles
 - medieval horses
 - napoleonic with line infantry and artillery
 - ww1
 - ww2
 - modern**
