# discussion approache

Rather often a debater is saying some statement and implies some conclusion.
It is often done when conclusion is not very PC to be pronounced.
For example - ukrainian is a dialect of the russian. It implies that russia has a rightful claim to interfier into ukrainiean souverinity. Russia is doing justice if it tries to forcefully conquer Ukraine. 
So it is important to make an interlocktor explicitely state all his implications.
