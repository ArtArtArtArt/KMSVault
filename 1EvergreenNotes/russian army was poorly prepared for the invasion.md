 - russia is using soviet tech which was preparing for the nuclear war(BTR 1-3)
 - it is built the same way as checkoslovakian pacification (vdv attacked airports, vehicles with markings because they attack from different sides, nkvd waling behind the army) ^874d48

**counter arguments?**
**also why is it important how russian army was prepared??**

also the fact that russia is mostly a [[russian pr army]] helps the military to over boost their own confidence
