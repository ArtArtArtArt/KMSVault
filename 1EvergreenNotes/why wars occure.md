Wars are costly but nevertheless they occur

Dispute - war - resolution

"Fearonm 1995 "Rationalist explanation for war"

If after every war there is a resolution - why go for war?

1) irrationality
2) leaders don't bear the cost of war but get the benefits
3) ??? why would rational actors choose to participate?? (next video is about this)
