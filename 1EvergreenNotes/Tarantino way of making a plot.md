# Tarantino way of making a plot
Tarantino once said that he is making a movie by having an idea what he is doing right to the middle and then he lets his characters do the rest. It is very obvious in Jango - when Waltz shoot DiCaprio. 

**What are other examples?**

Inglorious bustards in some case??
