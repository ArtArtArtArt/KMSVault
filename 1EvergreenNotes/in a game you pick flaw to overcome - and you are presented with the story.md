what if you pick the flaw that you have to 
overcome in a game

09: 00

for example in character selection you choose - that your story is aout overcomming the "trust no one flaw"
"trust everyone" - might be the flaw too

The main point is that character is supplied with the story which supports it - even if it is a back character.

You may use this idea in your open world game ([[idea how to create an open world game in unity]])
