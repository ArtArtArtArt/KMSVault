Scholars of russia are addicted to the russian state

russian historiography was founded by nikolai karamzin
he sees statehood as a measure of history

Chekhov’s sense of the placeless province and Gogol’s definition of Russian provincial space as meaningless are canonized, while Gogol’s Ukrainian works, which are rife with detail and meaning, are less studied.

Melnikov-Pechersky is considered a “minor” writer because of his regional content.

So if writer writes about "local" culture he is considered to be minor


"I tried to publish these conclusions in an article about regional identity in the Russian Empire, but the reviewers said that the Ukraine material didn’t fit, so I set it aside. Then, several years later, a Russian colleague asked if I had something to publish in his journal. I submitted the article. When I read the proofs, I saw that someone had added a footnote that derided the expression of Ukrainian identity as anti-historical and false. If I had not been a careful reader of the proofs, my article would have been conscripted into an attack on the origins of Ukrainian identity. As it was, it was somewhat of a dead letter  — from the perspective of the Anglophone academy, anyway — because it was published in Russian."


"I call on other scholars in our field to undergo this same process and join me in recovery from our addiction to the Russian state. Let’s stand with Ukrainians, their democracy, and their strong civic identity — not just on social media, but also in our work. Let us continue to create meaning in a manner inclusive of Ukrainian identity."
