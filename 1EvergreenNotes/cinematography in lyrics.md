I want more cinematography in lyrics

How to make my lyrics be personal and extremely atmospheric.
Story parts:
 - plot
 - character
 - setting

I have personal emotions - and now I should enhance them.
By adding plot parts 
 - dynamics
 - twist
 - character arc

Character
 - set up unusual character - merge unusual features

Setting
 - world enhances emotions - make them tangible

**not really clear how to use it?**
