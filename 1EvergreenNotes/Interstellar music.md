# Music does not help you to connect to your life

It feels that music enhances your emotions about real life movie etc.
But I claim that music does not enhance your life emotions - it creates something new that is only enhanced by life.

While listening ti interstellar music I feel inevitability and epicness, staring at a mountain that I am about to climb. And somehow all the obstacles are just a part of a big story regardless of the outcome. With this music I am not living through the emotions of competing with life, I am watching it from the outside but am certainly empathically connected to it.

Music helps us see our life from the outside - and the outside is the place where we can have religious experience.
Living through the tragedy feels horrible and you do not want to repeat it, but yet you want to come back to a movie about tragedy.
I claim that this is happening because your are watching it from the outside - the place where you can really appreciate all the colors of life.
Zizek says that we like movies precisely because we know they are not reality. And we have to be constantly reminded that they are not real.
Music makes us feel like we are reminded of non reality of our life. Feels like watching out life from the outside. That is why we feel that we are in the movie when we walk the street and listen to the song. And the outside is a place of living through emotions but not suffering through them.
And that leads us to the fact that suffering is a choice .And we sometimes cannot help choosing to suffer.

It is like my experience on Natura, where mushroom trip had all the attributes of being a bad trip but I choose not to suffer from it. I was connected to my wishes and desires and feeling, and I was expressing them freely. I took the bad stuff as a part of existence and I watched it with interest but from the outside.

Music does not prevent you from living your emotions, but at the moment they are not yours anymore and you are only empathizing this character. Empathical observing is living through but not suffering.

Here is an attempt to write an outline on this text:
