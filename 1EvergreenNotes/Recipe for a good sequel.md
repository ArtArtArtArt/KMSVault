# Recipe for a good sequel
So the recipe for a good sequel is to create a "flipped" version of itself. Then it is both new and familiar.

For example I think that Pirates of the Caribbean are doing it too. Some characters become flipped versions of themselves during the film. Norrington is Captain, then he is Admiral (flipped with another character) and then he is a drunkard (flipped with any other crew member) I think this happens to other characters too. 

todo
 - come up with new examples of the pirates of the Caribbean characters who flip in sequels

Also this flipping is happening in terminator and in SW ([[How Empire Turns Star Wars On Its Head]])

todo 
 -  Some new examples of movies with sequels built on this
 -  Some examples of good and bad sequels not using this technique
