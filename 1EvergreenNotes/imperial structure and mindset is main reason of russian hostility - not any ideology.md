I'll clarify: the problem is not in Putin. Neither it is in Navalny. The problem is in imperial structure of Russia and in its imperialist mindset. Any ideology be it Orthodoxy, Communism, Liberalism will be weaponized by the metropoly to dominate and discipline its colonies

here is an example how liberal ideology was used against Ukraine

they say that Ukraine is dangerous, it speaks nothing of human rights 
they critiques that Ukraine had an army (imposing the idea that we would be aggressive)
