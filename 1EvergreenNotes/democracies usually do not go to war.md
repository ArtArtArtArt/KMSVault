Democracies do not usually go to war (Spanish American war? cargo war? are exceptions)
Reasons why it is so:
Monadic - based on how democracies independently act
Dyadic - based on how democracies act with each other

Arg1:
War is against public interest - violence and economic disruption
Counter:
This happens only if the power of the general public is greater then the corporations (*then this is not a democracy*)
Arg1:
Countries like that do not sound as a democracy

Arg2:
More accustomed to compromise.
Counter:
Authoritarian systems may compromise too (*bad counter - small capacity to compromise is worth then bigger capacity - democracies tend to have a bigger one*)

Arg3:
Democracies have great appreciation for human rights.
Counter:
Democracies do not care about human rights while invading non democratic countries (*vietnam proves that a photo may change public opinion*)

Arg4:
Market democracies are likely to share common interests.
Counter:
Market democracies are fine having common interests with non democratic (*yeah but the argument is about likely*)
Counter2:
It looks like it is more about capitalistic peace but not a democratic peace (capitalists are more incentivized to cooperate)
Arg4: Democracies are more likely to be capitalist
Counter: This seems to be rather a correlation then a causation (*yeah so it does not mean that they are still more likely to be met together*)
Democracies are relatively new - you have e limited sample size (*all non monarchic regimes are relatively new and have small sample size*)
Arg4:
But the sample is pretty conclusive
Counter:
Also most democracies appeared after ww2 and all those democracies had common enemy - USSR
Counter2:
So it might be more about the distribution of power in the international system (*communist countries had a common democratic enemy yet they fought a lot USSR-China, Cambodia-Vietnam*)
Lots of democracies have nuclear weapons - maybe this is helping the peace (*what about democratic countries that do not have nuclear weapons but have territorial problems (**need examples***)
Counter:
Democracies still engage in a conflict (economic and covert operations)
Arg4: it is still not war
Historian: 
Rather then democracy leading to peace, peace leads to democracy. Democracies did not develop until borders where relatively settled (*ancient Greece?*). They appear only when limited causes for conflict (*this means that democracy is a good predictor of peace which does not contradict the argument*)

*You see how 3/4 arguments are won decisively, but because of the 4th one you still feel like the reality is uncertain. That is why maybe it is important to talk about strictly minimal requirements.*
