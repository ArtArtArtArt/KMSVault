# how memes go viral
viral starts not from influencers - that place is oversaturated.

so the idea has to win less polluted place in order to grow.
and then polluted influencer space hears it.
also you may emulate it using a lot of money but it may not be so effective.
I also know that memes are set to be viral the same way.
So be authentic for a small group - and you win.
