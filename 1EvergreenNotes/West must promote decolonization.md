Decolonization of russia is needed

Now it is considered true that
idea of Russian self-sacrifice in bringing "civilization" and orders to the "lawless" Caucasus peoples.

By conquering Caucasus they conquered Armenia and Georgia - far older civilizations.

They already think of hierarchy of nations based on their "age"

This creates tolerance to atrocities done by russia.

if we want russia to be democratic - it has to decolonize. 
The idea that Russia can "skip" over decolonizing towards democracy is like saying the U.S. could have maintained slavery or Jim Crow and still be considered a modern democracy. Or that the UK could repress and marginalize Ireland indefinitely but be considered liberal and democratic. Or France in North Africa. Belgium in the Congo, etc. Decolonization, in some genuine form, is not just a "nice to have," but an essential part of a healthy democracy. ^c7d582

We can start by acknowledging Russia's violently imperial foundations, as [@BotakozKassymb1](https://twitter.com/BotakozKassymb1)
and [@EricaMarat](https://twitter.com/EricaMarat)
note in their excellent piece.

We do not necesarily need russia broken, but all the national movements inside should be taken seriously.

(1) recognizing Russia for what it is, an empire, and engaging it as such; 
(2) speaking to a broader array of the population, and not the one projected by the Kremlin; and
(3) preparing for risks that come with unwieldy imperium.

To recap:
(1) Russia is an empire; 
(2) Russia can't be an empire and a democracy;
(3) To democratize, Russia must decolonize; 
(4) Decolonization doesn't necessarily mean dissolution; 
(5) To promote democracy, West must promote decolonization. ^c6b48b
