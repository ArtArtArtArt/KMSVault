 - <u>Crusader kings</u> - generated character traits, as long as it manifests in behavior. Players love coming up with narratives to explain the internal coherency of an individual even if it is generated randomly - **perhaps even more if the underlying numbers are transparent.**
 -  <u>Shadow of Mordor</u> - nemesis system. The first "open narrative" game (Ken Levine, BioShock). Procedurally generating enemy characteristics and post-fight scars can make players feel like they're battling specific and unique archrivals, not the same scripted sub-bosses that every other player will also encounter
 - <u>Spelunky</u> - procedurally generated level **shifts focus from mastering a level to mastering a set of rules, master rules and systems instead of geometry of the game**.
 - <u>Dwarfen Fortress</u> - simple components are layered which creates a world full of unique, complex and inpredictible world. Lineage of thousand of years
 - <u>RymdResa</u> - generate for creating the feeling of loneliness. 
 - <u>Civilization</u> - Togelius - “it’s absolutely crucial for the gameplay experience that you play a new map each time, which you will explore during the first half of a full game not knowing the layout of the world or which civilizations you will meet.” So it is important if discovery is a part of a gameplay loop.
