It certainly is something that is shifting your values.
But the fact that this is spiritual implies that this new experience is based on self exploration, but not set from the outside. Changes through personal experiences, so it is not dogmatic from the outside. However I can imagine "fabricating" personla experiences which are aligned with some ideology.

In that case ideology is something that is blind to personal experience by default.****
