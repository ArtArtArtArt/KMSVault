# Love is not enough

People go break up but still love each other.
Poeple love each other but still cause a lot of pain.
It feels that simething else should be happening here, some third firce should be present.

Sartre says that a true love is the person who knows how to torture you the best.

Zizek says the third thing is required - common cause, shared dream or ambition. Sharing a dream that you only want to do with the other person.

And it seems that a dream of a family is one of the best causes out there. All other dreams are too shallow but brining a new person to world is cirtably a project for life.

But the question remains - why do you need a partner even when you do not have a dream and a person to share with? What is so magnetic in love and the feelings that it brings?

I personally notice that I love being overwelmed by feelings. I love the way I do this notes, I love to feel sexual arousment which distorts my day. And it feels that I want to be somehow overwhelmed by my feelings towards a person. I think it is important to cultivate moments when I feel this even when they are not safe. It feels like passion is generated in places of the flow (like music or any other creativity) or danger (partner being desirable, flirt with strong jokes).
