So the recepie for a good sequel is to create a "flipped" version of itself. Then it is both new and familiar.

For example I think that Pirates of the Carribean are doing it too. Some characters become fliped versions of themselfes during the film. Nirrington is Capitain, then he is Admiral (flipped with another character) and then he is a drunkard (fliped with any other crew member) I think this happens to other characters too. 

#todo
 - [ ] come up with new examples of the pirates of the carribean characters who flip in sequals

Also this flipping is happening in terminator and in SW ([[How Empire Turns Star Wars On Its Head]])

#todo 
 - [ ] Some new examples of movies with sequles built on this
 - [ ] Some examples of good and bad sequls not using this techinque
