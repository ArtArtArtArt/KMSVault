How to change anything about yourself

 - Decide what you want to change and check if you need this change. Say that I am already X, and watch how you feel. It might feel OKAY, or it might feel great. Also you might feel if it is true or not. If it feels false - proceed. 
 - Every goal is an identity change.  So it basically is seeing yourself differently. 
 - The fuel for this process is courage. While this transformation is happening you might start feeling the imposter syndrome [[imposter syndrome]].  The amount of how much this emotion is felt shows how far you have to go.
 - Act like a person who is X would do. Every time notice how this feeling of imposter syndrome is getting smaller
 -  When this feeling is small - you've completed the transformation

So if you manage to do anything like X would do - then you are kinda X already.
