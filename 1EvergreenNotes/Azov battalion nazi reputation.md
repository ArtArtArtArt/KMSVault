# Azov battalion nazi reputation

Ukraine does not have a problem with azov battalion

1. The voting shows that Ukrainians do not vote right wing. Specially compared to France and Germany
2. There is no evidence of any campagning for the right ideologies - random walking down the street will never bring you to nazis (https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20220322-photos-of-nazi-symbols-in-ukraine-are-shared-out-of-context)
3. Stepan Bandera was in a nazi camp, he was a nationalist.
4. Asov batalion had a history of attracting right wing nationalists, it started off like that. It cleaned itself very quickly (?). It started as a group of volunteers going to war. They went to azov on not ideological basis - but because azov was fighting. But there are nazi types in every army in the world - if you go to special forces there are usually some people like that. **proofs???**


Today this word is basically used in a new way by russia [[nazi means denying russia for their ideology]]
