Use focus management instead of the time management

Think of on what you can focus in any free time - instead of having a rigid structure

This is close to [[rhythm example]] - using phases is basically a focus management

Also [[ruminations]] can be fixed like that - if you know what to focus on - you fight these useless thoughts.
