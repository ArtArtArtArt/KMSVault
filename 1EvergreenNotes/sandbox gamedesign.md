Balanced game might not be the goal  
And more sandbox is less goal oriented game

Sandbox game should create stimulus for creating a story using their mechanics. So the good question might be under what circumstances will we need to use specific mechanic.

### Middle and late game
Also the issue with the sandbox game is that it is not so interesting in the middle or late game. 


#### Predefind crises
Stelaris is fixing it with crises. CK3 might be doing the same when they properly add the mongols. EU4 is doing it using innovation eras.

#### Random challenges
Rimworld is generating random events that challenge you all the time. CK3 is doing it too.
