https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXrKGTPwfO8&ab_channel=Petter%C3%96gren

FSM Problems
 - Does not scale well (n^2 transtitions)
 - GOTO analogy problem
 - State feedback is optimal
	 - Nest Action should only depend on current world state not on current FSM state

**why BT cannot be turned into FSM???**
