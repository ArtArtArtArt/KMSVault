Bolsheviks destroyed socialism in first several months after they came to power (but they were creating state capitalism - so it was not so inconsistent)

USSR called itself social democracy
West left at the democracy part but it somehow praised the socialism part - which was absent too.

Lenin also said that they are building state capitalism.
No elements of workers control, super exploitation.
