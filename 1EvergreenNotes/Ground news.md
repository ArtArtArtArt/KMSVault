Ground news (3:00)
We need something very similar

Is it hard to create?
Aggregator?
How to determine which news are which ideologically?
Can I try creating something similar?

 - aggregate news from several places
 - attach the info about this places to the news
 - collect the statistics for every news piece

 - pick news sources
 - create a database about them
 - aggregate their articles

–î–∂–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ —Ü–µ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –º–µ—Å–µ–¥–∂—É

 - take two news pieces
 - run the algorithm of comparing if they are on the same topic

Path:
1. write your own headline comparator (multi language is a potential problem - maybe switching to English can help comparing with foreign media - but will it be possible to compare with russia)
2. try to aggregate headlines for the last day from two sites
3. show only the ones which appear in both (if any) 
4. create a file database with info about these websites
5. show aggregated info under the headline
6. start using it daily, expand and fix problems
