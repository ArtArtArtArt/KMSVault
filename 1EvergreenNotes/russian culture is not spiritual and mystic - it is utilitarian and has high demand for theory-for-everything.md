# russian culture is not spiritual and mystic - it is utilitarian and has high demand for theory-for-everything

In 2000-2010s Galkovsky reformed the Russian nationalist discourse

In order to make people think differently you have to start giving things new names (*like in cult*)
Galkovsky is probably one of the most productive name giver.

Cryptocolony - russia lost its' independence in 1917 and was puppeted by London.

It happened because winning in a WW1 would help russia capture istanbul and establish dominance in balcans and slavic central europe. West could not allow that.

Also china is a secretly cryptocolony of uk

UK and USA are mortal enemies - and all conflicts are a part of this conflict

and a lot of conspiracy and false methods (like exctrapolating population back (why does not it work?)

Sputnik and Pogrom (russian natiuonalist media) are fully on Galkovskys ideas.

Strelkov also mentions that "The twelve chairs" and the "Golden calf" were written by bulgakov (which is Galkovs theory again)

West thinks that Dugin is important for internal discourse - but Galeev claims that it is not.

This happens because dugin looks cool, knows languages (can give interviews)

The west is very orientalist in its perseptions of the outside world - dugin looks like rasputin so that will do
russia is persieved as spiritual, mystic, irrational culture
Those preconseptions are mostly wrong - Galeev says "It's extremely individualist and pragmatic culture that doesn't care about "traditional values"

Linear extrapolation of explaining things is very much inline with feelings of russians.

"The official narrative is fake, cuz I had a magic insight" - doesn't work well in Russia "The official narrative is fake, cuz I made a linear extrapolation. Here is a graph" - that can work out perfectly well

Thus obsession with Marx
Consider that Marx was very surprised by the quick and immediate success of his writings in Russia. The first edition of Das Kapital in German could not be solved for years while in Russia it was all bought in a few weeks. Marx was puzzled

*altyhough russia was not ready to implement communism economically a all - it was VERY ready for this kind of reasonig *
Medvedev said that new world will be pragmatic - pragmatism is their main cultural feature. Change of idelologies in the end was only supportiung the empire - ideology is utilitary*

Marx was puzzled that Russians whom he had bashed for so many years became his patrons. Well they were always enamoured by the fashionable ideas of the West, decided Marx That wasn't very fair. Russians were enamoured not so much by the fashionable as by the All-explaining ideas

Galkovsky became so important not because his ideas were especially bright or his logic especially rigorous, but rather because he satisfied the pre-existing Russia demand for a logical and rational General Theory of Everything. That exists irrespectively of Galkovsky
