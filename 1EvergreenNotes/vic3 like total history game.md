# vic3 like total history game

what if I did the tribe simulation game but I would use more high-level provinces with slots for hunting and gathering.
This slots would have a real location and they would interact with each other (like a minimap) 

But why would we need whole areas then? 
I suppose because the amount of cells inside a province might change due to different factors. Cities would occupy several of these cells. Also split and merge of cells might happen due to the fact of what is build there.
