What if searching for a charater returns only your closest poeple + some amount of middle range foreign people once per year. 
So you try to find somebody, you get results and you may choose - wait for one year ro find even more people, or to pick from what you have found.
Also you might pay more money to seach even further. Searching for people is hard and might be affected by language.
