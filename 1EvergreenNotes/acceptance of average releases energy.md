Acceptance of your average releases inner tension,
Brain is designed to get better - so relax exhale and believe that you will become better overtime

*So every time you feel stress remember that you are average in what you are trying to do - this should break the narcissistic cycle*

Narcissist urge creates energy and stress - if I do not want it I remind myself that I am average - this releases most of the creative energy - do it all the time when *fail cost is too high.*
