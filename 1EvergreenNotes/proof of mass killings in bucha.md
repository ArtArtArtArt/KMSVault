satellite images probe that people where killed while russian troops where in bucha

Photos are on Maxar service

[[Russian war crimes list]]
[[russian crimes against kazakhs]]
[[russian crimes against Chechnya]]

also I believe small twitter accounts - it seems that paid propagand (which it should be if they wnat people to spread lies) will not concentrate on small accounts

Also I have 2 handshake distance to these events, also I partially saw destruction on the way to Kyiv
