# time estimates generate unwanted pressure
Keep in mind that estimates generate pressure.
This is specially important for side projects - because your morale plays big role there.
If you already have dedicated time for some activity - you do not need a time estimate. 
Time estimate is needed mostly for creation of motivation. You should do work without it.
Also it should not be used as a metric of moving forward - pick something more specific.
Time estimate also is a gamble - you will be very demotivated if you fail it, yet you hardly ever have an experience to do it right.
