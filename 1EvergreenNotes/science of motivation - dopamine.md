 - two types of narcota
	 - gambling  - seldom extremely high peaks - makes you want to play more) (also toxic ex has this effect)
	 - narcota - stable high peaks - reduced after some time
	 - both very bad and should be avoided to maintain a stable baseline of dopamine
	 - Your dopamine reward is either predetermined by physiology (in case of food and sex) or by your value system (of what you think is cool) 
	 - The best thing for dopamine baseline is medium spikes of unpredicted magnitude for different aspects of life (to avoid tolerance). So **you need both wins and looses in your life in order to have your baseline to be normal**.
 - therapy is very good for healthy dopamine doing stuff. Because it needs
	 - presence. Layering and artificial rewards decrease dopamine association with an activity. The bad goal - is a reward like goal - it will decrease your will to participate in an activity. Presence is cultivated by therapy
	 - the feeling that you chose to do it. The choice is a big focus of therapy
	 - The knowledge why what you do is good for you. That is a way to create healthy goals. That is why goal should be an identity (so that when you do activity you are already that identity) or if goal is very specific - it should be intermediate to creating a system that you will follow (again participating in activity is already getting the goal). That is how goal can help you dopaminize the activity. Also learning stuff (and maybe motivational stuff) can create the feeling that you know that this is good for you. 
		 - Layering is close to goal - if you reinforce your activity with some other dopamine activity at the same time you reduce good association with the first activity and are less likely to do it later 
	 - Therapy makes you concentrate on your "resource".  Which practically means be present so much that you allow you psyche and organism to self regulate
 - I was doing everything absolutely correct for my dopamine
	 - Cold showers improve levels of dopamine, if you are looking into the feelings itself (or as I do - exercising relaxation under stress) you have healthy dopamine influence. But if you view it as a supplement to do anything else - it will undermine that other activity in some time
	 - Sport. I am concentrating on feeling good and tired afterwards and on the looks of my body in the mirror while I do it. I like understanding that my *** is lowered too. I also should concentrate on muscles and friction, and listen less music.
	 - Intermediate fasting. If you are not concentrated on food as a reward works great too. I am concentrated on the feeling of lightness in my body.
	 - Sugar - influences tastiness of all other food in a long term. Not having it means mediate spikes in dopamine for whole foods.  Porn - the same. Hyperstimulation - is a drug, makes you motivated to use only the hyperstimulation and decreases interest in other activities.
 - Oxytocin is also supportive for dopamine. So have quality social interactions - and dopamine levels will have medium spikes
