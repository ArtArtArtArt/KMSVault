# day schedule for me

It seems that it is nice for me to think of a work day as a period of the day were I try to do something useful. At any point of time I know what to do next - so I just do it.
Focusing on metrics and other stuff is very damaging for my morale.  ^b7fdc2

Also it is nice to separate day on three parts each of which has it's own aim.


1) Do things that inspire me, creative stuff or maybe something very pleasant 
2) Job - just do what is useful until you feel that consciences says to you that you are fine
3) social stuff, active stuff
