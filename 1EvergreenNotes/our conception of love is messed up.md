Is love passive or active?
(Erich From The art of loving)
in culture love is usually described as passive.
So people focus on making themselves lovable rather then loving.
Personality market is a thing. 
You have fallen in love when there is a sweet spot between social value and desire for you.

When men became more feminine it is congratulated but we should not think of non feminine men as something bad.

Passive loving - how do I become loved?
Active loving - how do I love?

love is not intuitively known
From says love is art - it is activity.

You have to practice and you cannot stop doing it because you do not feel like it. 
You also have to have faith that eventually you will succeed. The same mindset and artist comes to his art.

Bell Hooks - all about love
love as action brings accountability and responsibility. 

Love is to nurture the flourishing of someone else?

Love is about giving
And in our culture it is associated with the sacrifice. 
From says it should not necessarily be that way.
Giving for the giving is the best way to fight existential threat.
We feel power energy and aliveness.

When you give love you give everything that makes up you (*and that is precisely why it is valuable*)

*what is you meet someone who views love in utilitarian way - what would you do? maybe try to show another way of loving and see if it works.*

in modern culture we see the narrative for women
love = being loved = receiving stuff

for men it is
love = being loved = receiving social approvement ??

love may not be a bargain on a social market, 
*it is a bargain on a psychological market*

Proper love is counterculture
I cannot focus on giving if people on social media showing off what they got.

## Hyperreal love

Jean Baudrillard we interact more with hyper reality then reality itself.

Apocalypse now
It feels real, but it is because it comes from out perception of what Vietnam war was, not because we experienced it. *moreover Zizek says that we can take pleasure from movies precisely because we know it is not real*

Media that was an imitation of reality becomes more real - thus HYPER real.

Stephen West (Philosophize this) 
TV shows originally drew inspiration from real people, but later started doing it from other TV shows 
(*then I start understading the guy from the video who said that previous directors were inspired by their lives, modern directors are inspired by other movies*)

Thus romantic stories - are reflections of reflections of real stories. And then we try to experience something like this in our lives.

*That is why we can't help but be disenchanted by commonly depicted themes. That is why Lacroise Pizza is so cool - it did not feel like a hyperreality. It felt real because the director directly translated real stories into the cinema*

Imaginary dictates reality.

## if he wanted he would
includes
partner understands without communication
how anything is done if both partners follow the same rule?
no way to notice how other person is showing love

## red flags
Kim Baker
Red flags are whispers form our intuition that something is not right.
