USSR did not achieve socialism - Lenin called it state capitalism.
Ceasing the state was the means of transition.

*any ideology which seeks ceasing the full control over the state in order for the proper transition to happen will inevitably attract people for which ceasing the state is a goal. Moreover this thought has a preposition that dismantling the from the inside is somehow easier then dismantling the state from the outside. And people who are ready to do anything to take control of the state have much easier time defeating the people who want to take the state to use it for some transform, because the first are not bound by any values outside of the power itself.*
