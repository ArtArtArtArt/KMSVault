Hyper successful people that have never experienced lack of negative motivation are very bad advisors. If a person has never really felt unmotivated (crushed by life already) or had workaround this only using brute force (shame and anger) - then he has nothing to offer for other people except for maybe contentious emotional expressions.

They have nothing to give.
If they come from poverty - those who are not there will not understand you, those who are there - do not need your advice (except for the positive example).
If you were shamed or bullied - the same thing applies. The merely fact that you did achieve anything is enough - there is nothing you can say more.

If you only managed to do anything by shaming yourself and being angry at your self - the only thing you can give is to make other people feel ashamed and angry - which is certainly a fuel for action. But may be a preposition for deeper abyss.

In these cases you are in no position to lecture people because **you poses no general knowledge** that can be helpful.
Emotions in your speech mean more - because they might be inspirational or shaming - but content does not really matter.

The most interesting people are people who achieved something without negative motivation. Who where not bullied or despaired into success. They may have some interesting insights into how they are managing the time and that is all.
 Not because I discard what they achieved, but because I admit that I there is nothing to be taken for others.

Your passion and example will inspire. Content of your words does not really matter.

so **is rarely matters what successfull person is saying**.

Other reason for success is spacial opportunities. Which is also not transferable by words.

They may tell you what they did. But the problem is that not only we do not know what part of their success is luck but also we may not be able to repair it because we will not have so much psycho resources for that.






























# hyper successful people

Statement: *It does not matter what a successful persons' day looks like, what he values and what are his routines. His advises are even less valuable if he came from the "bottom". If you want to listen to what is essential to success - listen to people already born to success.*

1. People that are considered successful are not necessarily aware of why is it so. What success consists of (luck and skill)
2. They might be experts in the field, but being an expert does not necessarily lead to success.
3. What they certainly can share is their passion (which can be contagious) and nor the words say neither their values they promote do not matter.
4. How to know if a successful person worth listening to? This person lacks negative motivation. He did not come from a bad background and he was not bullied. Then he can share what he did to support the energy inside - that is additional info you may take.
5. Listen to people born to already successful families for example or in very successful circumstances. Because then you may learn what is bare working minimum that certainly has to be done to achieve it. That is almost the only way to distinguish what attributes to luck and what needs to be done. But be aware - son of an actor wants to be a better actor, so it is important that son is in other field then father.
