# universe probability with Bayes

When a person says something he is telling the truth from a certain perspective.
Is it possible to create a model of the world where every person is an infinite set of agents which at least one of which is telling the truth at the specific moment in time.

So the analysis is shifted towards trying to understand which if the agents is the most probable one. And here we may use the Bayes' theorem?
Every event is bringing some world closer. 
So the event X has happened. The world where X is done to achieve the goal has become more probable.
But also intentional deceiving world where X is done to make someone believe that Xgoal is real goal has become more probable too.
Also mistake is an option too. X is done because in the world of actor it brings closer the goal, but it may not be true.

So the method is - we are trying to identify two worlds, each arguments gives some points to the world.


World is a set of scenes.
Different worlds might share some scenes and be different in other scenes. 

The history analogy might be a weak argument.

Try comparing the worlds by simply ranking all the arguments (arguments should be based on verifiable truths). The goal is to compare two worlds and maybe your gut feeling of what is right will be shifted.
