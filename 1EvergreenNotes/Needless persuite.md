# Magentic Rejection

Sometimes I am persuing the girl which is clearly not interested. Feels like I am closing my gut feeling on social cues at that moment. I think this happens as a distraction from not getting what I really want - and it is very important to try to understand what is standing behind. True understanding leads to release of tension in the body - that is how I know I am onto something. 
Also it is intresting to notice why am I choosing this strategy of almost certain rejection to anything else. Is there something magnetic, convinent or familiar in a situation like this?
