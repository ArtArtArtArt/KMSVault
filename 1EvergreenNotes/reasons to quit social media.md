it is good to quit social media because:
 - Higher quality leisure (slower content)
 - Lower anxiety
 - Privacy(*I am not bothered by this at all*)
 - You stop being manipulated by it (you stop the illusion of the community - when people stopped for 30 days - no one noticed)


*these are basically reasons to reduce phone usage
I would also say that I can see less soft erotic - which helps my mood very much.
It would be good to be exposed to it if I had an active sex life - but it is harmful if I do not*
