By 1960 France had to release all it's colonies

Cooperation Agreement kept these countries dependent - their currency would use CFA Franc currency

Leader of Guinea Sekou Toure - I prefer to be poor in freedom then rich in slavery

French government has cut all foreign aid to him, tried destabilizing the government

They also flooded the country with fake Guinea banknotes. 


It feels that everything that russia is doing to Ukraine is the same that other empires do to their former colonies - the only difference that russian colonies are in europe - so it is more visible.
