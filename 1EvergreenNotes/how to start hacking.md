# how to start hacking

[https://youtu.be/2TofunAI6fU](https://youtu.be/2TofunAI6fU)


and example of the pass of learning

 - html
 - try to create your own OS (he used VBS, but I might want to use C++ and write a clone of the DOS)
 - write an example of the web application with the database
 - learned linux 
 - got into hackerspace
 - stripe ctf


programmer/sysAdmin uses the same knowledge as a hacker but applied differently


learn what can go wrong with languages and databases?

*To start learning hacking I have not to start learning something else, I have to continue learning with other mindset - HOW TO BREAK IT*
**any suggestion on how to change the mindset?**
I have to ask one more question - how to break it?
 - from the code
 - on the binary level
 - on the API level
