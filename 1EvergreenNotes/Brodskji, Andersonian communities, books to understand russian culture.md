1) Spoken vernaculars (sounds-based) 
2) Sacred languages (signs-based)

Andersonian paradigm - Those who use the same sacred language comprise a separate sacred community (=civilisation)

Within each sacred community people spoke on multiple vernaculars


Equating premodern sacred communities to modern national communities is a major fallacy. That's wrong, even if they bear the same or a similar name. In modern Russia the word Russian refers to a nation. In medieval Russia - to the sacred community operating across ethnic lines

I would also suggest some books that absolutely must be translated into English asap: 1. Bazhanov. I was Stalin's secretary 2. Aven. Time of Berezovsky 3. Khazin, Schegloff. A stairway to the sky 4. Roschin. The country of lost empathy 5. Pokrovsky. Russian history

*I also know know about linguistic primordial soup or linguistic continuum. All languages are slowly flowing one into another.*

Also picking a language and making it a literature language is merely a decision which language will be learned in school. There is no literature language without school. There is no literature as a subject without school.
School birthed some disciplines which did not exist without school.
