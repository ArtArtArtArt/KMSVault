# French true face is not European
Black people in France are not foreigners and invaders.
They were the part of the empire, and empire granduer cannot be detached from their colonies. 
And also every empire (even after it's formal death) is drifting towards it's common denominator of their lands. 
That is not that blacks came to the Paris. That is a true face of a Paris, which was just hidden.

We can see the same situation in the moscow. There are a lot of Muslims for the near east there. But they did not "came" there. It is a true face of an empire. 
And empire is a mixture of all it's citizens, regarding internal hierarchy , as all it's achievements is a mixture of all the contributions of it's inhabitants.
