# Enhanced tech tree
the tech tree might be for the specific tool

for example - military equip tech tree

main parts:

 - shield
 - sensor
 - communication
 - weapon
 - transportation

and asymmetrical answers 
strong shield - needs a weapon to pierce it
sensor need a way to jam it
communication needs a way to jam it
weapon needs a way to block it
transportation needs a way to stop it

asymmetrical answers might be other equip, other way to use old equip (doctrinal)

What should be fixed - 
 - types of damage ()


sensors might be passive or active.

shield blocks type of damage X of special amount.
the behavior of how to use the shield should be invented too.

tech is just a new device, but  engineering says how specifically to equip it and doctrine says how to use it (also in combined arms fashion)



the problem of combined arms - how to use the weapons synergistically



So I need a system which creates answer to the problem with available resources and the tries to block other exploit.

So the game is exploit hunting - you have a small window of opportunity when an exploit can be used to it's full potential.


The universal way of battle is :
 - find
 - approach 
 - attack

so defense is:
 - hard to find
 - hard to approach
 - block the attack
 - counterattack - make enemy defend


I may try to create a tech tree on all of this.
The tech tree also should include the behavior - the ways to use the techs.


Defencieve structures are also a thing.

There is a mirriad of ways on how to 
 - engineer object
 - place it in a specific location
 - behave with it

Also resource availability will influence how you use it


This system might create a lot of inventions that are useless. How to pick what to use?
Some political events might influence it as well.

Logistics is important for the war too.
Fighting against environment is important too.

Invention types:
 - Converter
 - Resource usage
 - engineering - how it should be shaped
 - usage - doctrines of personal use and group use
