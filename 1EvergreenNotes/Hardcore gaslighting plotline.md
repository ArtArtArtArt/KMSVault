# Hardcore gaslighting plotline

## Hardcore gaslighting plotline

 ---

### Inspiration
It is something that Urkaine has experienced. Seeing Russia as a friend and ignoring radicals, almost seeing  radicals as crazy people, and slowly commig to understanding that all, even strangely looking statements, are true.
Also Ukraine has experiences this with the scale of corruption under Janukivych. We thought that he was at max moderately corrupted - but then Pshonka palace and golden loaf.

### Structure
So the story can be based on this premis :
Main character is suspecting something -> then he is fully gaslighted to mediocre explanation (nobody is a bad guy, everyone is moderately bad) -> slowly coming to understanding that everything is as bad as he was told at the beginning -> understanding that everything is even worse, masks fall down, endgame shows who is who.
