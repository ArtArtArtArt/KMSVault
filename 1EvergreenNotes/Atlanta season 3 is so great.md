# Atlanta season 3 is so great
Why Atlanta season 3 is so great.

We are cursed too - first season

they follow a theme, not a plot. Theme driven tv show. And the theme is - racism is curse for both white and black.

Half of episodes are non real or non reliant narrator. But the epilogue mixes both realities - and I do not know what to feel about it. And I am okay if nothings happens from it.

Also whole season is horror or thriller like. We always have some behind the scenes spying or something like that. 

We see something in the season not if it serves the plot - but if it serves the theme. Like in real life there is no particular MAIN plot in here.

I really like surreal humor part of it
