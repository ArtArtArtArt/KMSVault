# Evergreen note
One of the most important things in taking evergreen notes for me is [[rejection of structure enforcing]]. Which means that I do not impose structure at any time (which is usually hierarchical tree), I just create atomic notes about concepts and then watch an ontology erasing.

**what are other pluses? **
