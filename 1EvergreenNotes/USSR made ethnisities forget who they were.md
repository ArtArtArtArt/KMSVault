Why everyone needs to stop romanticizing the soviet union:

“Born during the Soviet period, we grew up with the belief that everything which existed before the revolution was bad, or it was almost as if it did not exist.”
“We were taught to love someone else’s fictional made-up country, and be ashamed of our own roots.”
“We were so long conditioned to believe that yesterday did not exist and that there is only a made-up future, artificially created for us by ideologists in tall towers.”
The Soviet Union robbed us of our history, identity and freedom. It killed, starved and pillaged people for years. Now is our time to reclaim our own story.
Ah and before people make fools of themselves and go on offending my grandmother - she died this year as she was evacuating from Kyiv which FYI was being bombed by the same regime that held up the Soviet Union.
