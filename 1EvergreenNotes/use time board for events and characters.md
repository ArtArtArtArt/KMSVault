# use time board for events and characters
[[Tarantino writes back characters as they have their own book]]

what if you try to write the story where every character is written fully - has his own story in his own style.
And while developing so many characters you put them into a story board where X is place and Y is time. 
This way you may find cool ways to find interconnections between the characters and their plot lines
