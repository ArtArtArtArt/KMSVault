active recall and spaced repetition help you store the info in your working memory. But good encoding techniques help you store in the long term memory.
It is good to start with encoding as soon as possible.

When you try to remember you retrieve(decode) from the LTM and then we collect it from the working memory.

This actually looks like RAM and hard memory

We encode by attaching meaning to the information - through the power of cognitive load. Essentially having the information in your attention for some time (like cahce??). This load can be trained - so more stuff can be processed on a higher level and better encoding might be found. This cognitive load is actually unpleasant, feels like confusion and takes a lot of energy -  and it is oppose to bored and sleepy feelings.

If we do not do it - we will forget from the working memory.

Active recall and spaced repetition is working against forgetting curve ![[Spaced repetition]] 
But this forgetting curve's intensity is dependent on the quality of encoding. 
This is a very short term strategy if you encoded badly.
And if you encoded greatly - then you do not really need it.

## In relation to Obsidian
Obsidian is special for encoding.
You do not do encoding on the spot - but rather make a note (although I would like to practice cognitive load and increase the quality of the notes)
But you made the notes because you felt that there was something important there - so unconsciously you felt the potential.

Then you reread the notes. And you invoke spaced repetition but also you are trying to find new connections - which means encoding starts now.

So that is convenient - but prevents you from training cognitive load.
