# Why Didn't the Spanish Colonies Unify Like the USA

There was no imperative to unite because the empire they broke from was very weak.
Bolivar tried to unite some countries - insipred by USA 
San Martin did that too.
Bolivar was republicatn and San Martin wanted monarchy.

USA capitalist approach encouraged unity because capitalists had a lot to gain, but it was not true for the extractive economy of the South America.

South Amercia has much more natural obstacles for the intercolonial communication. Also extractive economy did not win from lieracy. Also spain forbid intercolony communication.
