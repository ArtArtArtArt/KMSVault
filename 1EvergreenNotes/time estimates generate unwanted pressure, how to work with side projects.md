# time estimates generate unwanted pressure, how to work with side projects
Keep in mind that estimates generate pressure.
This is specially important for side projects - because your morale plays big role there.
If you already have dedicated time for some activity - you do not need a time estimate. 
Time estimate is needed mostly for creation of motivation. You should do work without it - because money is your motivation.
Also it should not be used as a metric of moving forward - pick something more specific - if you ever need it.
Time estimate also is a gamble - you will be very demotivated if you fail it, yet you hardly ever have an experience to do it right.

**but how then I can make sure  that my side projects are not forgotten?**
maybe use methodology - your side projects are always spent time on - but the goal is not clear.

This is the way you might start tictok/youtube

Also deadlines and goals are needed in cooperation with people.

Mission impossible rule and pr rule may help here too
([[cool rules(tips) for timemanagement#^e6dcf1]] and [[cool rules(tips) for timemanagement#^342f8b]])
for your side project quality might not be the end goal - so create a ridiculous several hour deadline for something - like a sziget mission.
