[[Edward Saїd]]  
“Culture and Imperialism”
**try reading this book**

Imperialism is thinking about, settling on, controlling land that you do not possess, that is distant, that is lived on and owned by others.

Russia posses colonies which are not distant lands.

 - It is outward-looking, therefore less aware of its own chauvinism. 
 - The idea of own greatness.
 - The desire to seize the land of others, establish their own institutions there, and conduct their own activities. 
 - The idea that only they know how to do any sort of business, and imposing this “knowledge” on others.

Whole culture is permeated with imperialistic ideas. 
Here we can remember writers and what they said about other nations (pushkin etc.)
