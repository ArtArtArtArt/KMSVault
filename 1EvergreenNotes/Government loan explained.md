Government loan is different because it can print money

Government can loan from people

But treasury may sell obligations and central bank can buy them - so people are not really needed. That is basically "money print". That happens because government has monopoly on emission.

That is why everyone is holding dollars and euros - these economies are very diversified.
They are stable yes, but diversification is more important. The swiss is stable but very small.

you need
