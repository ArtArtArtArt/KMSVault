# MGMT and divorce

MGMT has a reoccuring image - the innevitable divorce. 

We'l have children then have a divorce (Time to pretend)

There is something releasing in realizing that divorce will happen

**i did not find anything else on divorce as a sign of maturity**

![[divorce is somehow specifically shameful for me]]
