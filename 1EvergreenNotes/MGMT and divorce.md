# MGMT and divorce

MGMT has a reoccuring image - the innevitable divorce. 

We'l have children then have a divorce (Time to pretend)

There is something releasing in realizing that divorce will happen

**i did not find anything else on divorce as a sign of maturity**

*but it is very interesting that it resonated with me - I bear something very shameful in divorce and specially in children of divorced parents - should not I get used to the fact that it might happen?*

**Maybe I should think of paths like this - and one of which is that I have no family**
