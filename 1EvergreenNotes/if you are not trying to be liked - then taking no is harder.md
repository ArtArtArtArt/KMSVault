# if you are not trying to be liked - then taking no is harder

The more preoccupied you are with your partner liking you the less the probability that you notice how you like them

**And then taking NO as the answer becomes harder (because in your head you are on a mission to make them like you)**

End goal (making them like you) may not be satisfying  

remember this
