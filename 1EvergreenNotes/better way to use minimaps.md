cool minimap shows where you are and incentivizes you to use your surroundings to get where you need

some games use minimaps to such an extend that you can practically run in the minimap

what to do with secrets???


Some minimaps mitigate it with waypoints - and the pass is shown in the actual world

Also stealth missions are busted - if minimaps are showing the line of sight of the enemies.


A good usage of waypoint integral to the gameplay is Sadow of Collosus

Landmarks and lighting should guide players

Turning off the minimap is not the best thing because some games rely on them really heavy
