Putin is an enemy of today, russian liberals is an enemy of tomorrow.
Liberals still want to preserve the russian empire so they will end up with russism inevitably.

also they want to see Ukraine as a part of "modern (updated) russian world" and they do not recognize that [[russia is still an empire]] they do not talk about russian decolonization ([[West must promote decolonization]]) and they do not see it as a necessary step towards democracy ([[West must promote decolonization#^c7d582]])
They also see "russian world" as something that has happened naturally, spontaneously and inevitably and they see it as something has to be maintained (but maybe in other form).
And I claim "russian world" is unnatural, deliberately violent, alien and dangerous to Ukrainians (and presumably other nations that are considered to be a part of it) and has to be avoided at all costs. Even if they suggest something that looks nice on the outside - the risk is just too high, and our experience has shown it.

**would be nice have examples**

They think they are paying a compliment when they say Ukraine will be a part if a new russian world. And colonized Ukrainian will feel like he is elevated (higher tier nation representative - russian one - thinks that we can be a new center of their empire). But in reality it is reforming the same oppressive entity under the new skin.
