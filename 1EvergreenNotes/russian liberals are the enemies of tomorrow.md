Putin is an enemy of today, russian liberals is an enemy of tomorrow.
Liberals still want to preserve the russian empire so they will end up with russism inevitably.

also they want to see Ukraine as a part of "modern (updated) russian world" and they do not recognize that [[russia is still an empire]] they do not talk about russian decolonization ([[West must promote decolonization]]) and they do not see it as a necessary step towards democracy ([[West must promote decolonization#^c7d582]])
They also see "russian world" as something that has happened naturally, spontaneously and inevitably and they see it as something has to be maintained (but maybe in other form).
And I claim "russian world" is unnatural, deliberately violent, alien and dangerous to Ukrainians (and presumably other nations that are considered to be a part of it) and has to be avoided at all costs. Even if they suggest something that looks nice on the outside - the risk is just too high, and our experience has shown it.

**would be nice have examples**

They think they are paying a compliment when they say Ukraine will be a part if a new russian world. And colonized Ukrainian will feel like he is elevated (higher tier nation representative - russian one - thinks that we can be a new center of their empire). But in reality it is reforming the same oppressive entity under the new skin. 


also a liberal who does not recognize russian racism now is a bad one too
they all go hand in hand - russia is inherently racist, racism prevent russia from seeing itself as a colonial power, while it is colonial it will not be democratic, while it is not a democratic it will not stop being an empire


BUT

France is democratic - but it still is having very extractive neocolonial relations with africa - so in some form it remain being an empire
russia might be fully democratic - but still continue economical blackmailing and supporting of authoritarian corrupted governments 
[[France acts as russia when it comes to their former colonies]]
