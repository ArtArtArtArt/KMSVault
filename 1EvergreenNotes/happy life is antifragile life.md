Happy life is not being happy all the time.
Ben Shahar (Happier no matter what)


Nassim Taleb - antifragility
for example muscle (grows bigger in places that were attacked)

PTG - post traumatic growth

Study of happiness - is study about what conditions we should put in place to increase the likelihood of growing from hardship.


Paradox
If you focus on happiness they usually feel less happy

Happiness is a good thing - valueing it is problematic (*maybe we have something like this with love?*)

Resolve is persuing indirectly 

Break happiness down to components and persuing them is good way out
SPIRE
- Spiritual - sense of meaning in work and life (?)
- Physical - stress (vacations and free time) - lack of recovery and recreation (so so)
- Intellectual - curious, deeply engaging with material (+)
- Relational - quality time with people we care about and we care about us (friends - great, personal is absent)
- Emotional - pleasure, gratitude (games+, sex-, music+, other creativities+, art+)
