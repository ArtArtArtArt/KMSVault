# Protoganist turns to an antagonist
Proto is gathering a support group based in hate to antagonist who is already dead. He is fighting the followers if that antagonist. And in his methods he is slowly turning to an antagonist, and while his group looks the same. Eventually they loose and they create the same resistance group which hints on the loop nature of narcissistic magical thinking and a hole which leads to turning into your own shadow.
The fact that the group is against antagonist is a mark of them noticing their own shadow in the antagonist group.
