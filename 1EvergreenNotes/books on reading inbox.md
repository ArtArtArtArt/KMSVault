# books on reading inbox

```dialogue
#What to do with big books on my reading inbox?

<maybe it should be done with adding a hash tag

>but then the reading list will be filled with this all

<but I can search using tags which will prevent it from clouting

>ok but what about books that stay there all the time?

<maybe we shuold clean the list once per month?

>then some day should be scheduled for this and we are bad at scheduling the days

<we may try to read books really fast if this is not for pleasure. Pleasure books are never on this list. So the goal is to read fast and we do not need a whole day for that.

>then we do not really need tags for that too - we just read somethign from the reading inbox and that is all.

<but reading inbox is not perfect - we cannot have bookmarks there

>so we need a special type of note and a special inbox for ongoing readings

<yes and we should try to use it when we start reading some book. Also some time should be spent for that too. And that special note hold the progress of reading.
