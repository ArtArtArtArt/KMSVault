The Crimean annexation was immediately supported by the meme of the movie 20 years prior Brat 2

Current derangement of the Z war may seem as an unfortunate accident to a foreigner who hadn't lived in the context of the Russian culture. But it seems logical and pretty much inevitable to the ones who did and consumed its cultural content.

Russian book market prepared people for the war too

There are tons of myths of "stolen victories" and "betrayed Russia".
And the rise of "Popadantsy"

**There is a misunderstanding that russia is anti nazi - but actually russia hates nazi only for the betrayal and not for their ideas**
Enjoy Russian dream. "Comrade Hitler. Execute Churchill!" Description: "Popadanets gets into Adolf Hitler' body.

More soviet nazi union

and this
"The Son of the Reich". Info: "The USSR must again defeat a treacherous attack by The Entente. Red Army and Wehrmacht fight together against the New World Order. British pilots bomb cities and refugees".

"Novorossiya pilot" awakes in a body of Josef Stalin's son Vassily, a war pilot, and wins the war, revealing a Western agent Khrushchov, saving Stalinism


**Revanchist books were sold everywhere, revanchist movies were blockbasters, they literally formed Russian culture after 1990s.**


Many of those who went to Russia read Tolstoyevsky, and believed they knew Russia. Instead, they had to spend a couple of years on LiveJournal and read Krylov, Holmogorov, Galkovsky, Kenigtiger, Legatus_Minor (ever heard, heh?) and others to understand what is going on.

A lot of russian cultural discussion was happening in JJ.


There were also state-funded movies about Popadantsy. The first one (maybe) was "We are from the future", produced in 2008 by state-owned TV channel Rossiya. A group o 4 not patriotic Russians get to 1941 and get patriotic:

ame 2010, "The Fog" movie was produced: a unit of Russian conscripts insult WW2 vets and get teleported to 1941, where they have to fight for their life against Wehrmacht.

You see the pattern: movies were produced by state media companies with state money in 2008-2012. It was a state-run program of creating a hyper-militarised mood and forcing young generation to feel the WW2 has never ended, and this generation HAS TO FIGHT IT TO THE BLOODY END.
