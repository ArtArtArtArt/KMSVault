What I want from Russians:
1) To admit their responsibility
2) To respect my right not to have anything in common with them

What I don't want:
1) To hear any excuses about 'not all Russians' 
2) To insist that I should support them or do anything with them even after my refusal

I've long since lost interest in any Russian opposition movement. Now I'm only interested in backing any national or regional movement for autonomy that arises.(c)
