# completing a game 100 percent

completing a game 100 percent may lead you to playing it not the way that you intended to

video game -> checklist (which might be nice nevertheless)

some games are not designed to be 100 percent finished

the completion is enjoyable if you can connect the journey to reward

a good reward for completing everything should be a reward that influences gameplay in a meaningful way

Ori and the will of the wisps - secrets upgrade ori (*which I personally do not like - the difficulty of the game should not be influenced by secrets*) and sometimes change the environment.
*I feel that it would be nice to know in advance - is that secret about upgrade or something else - BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW*

It is good to design a game so that every little trip outside your path gives you something beneficial.

Zelda Breath of the Wild - Korok seed - is everywhere, easy to find, world feels alive - but there is too many of them - competing to the full would be horrible - 900 of them, collecting them all would be very hard.
Collecting all of them gives you a golden piece of shit - so the devs clearly did not intend to do it

Achievements should encourage player interact with the world in a different way.

If achievement is based on randomness - it is very frustrating.
Maybe the goal is to make player feel special
HOI4 is EVERYTHING wrong with achievements.


Achievements are relatively new to games - and it is not clear who they should be tailored too (*maybe if you do not want all the achievements to be done - show 100 percent done on the game even if not everything is really done*)


Why people do it
 - They want to extend the with the world for some more time in a meaningful way
 - They want a big number grow bigger


It is nice to decide that you will complete the game in advance - so the game ends where it end and not on a random note you missed somewhere
