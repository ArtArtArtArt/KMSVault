Emergence of plow changed.
With the plow now people could cultivate grain - which was highly effective

Anemism went away with finding of the plow - you cannot warship an animal if it is working on you.
So spiritual ideas changed because of it. Hard to worship a cow if you beat it. (but what about India?)

Before women had to use a stick for growing and did the gathering. Men did the hunting.

After the plough men had to do use the plough because of better upper body, women started having more children because of the change in the ration and also had miscarriages if they were using it while being pregnant.

Most economic income was brought by men since then, and the ration of female to male gods started to decline since then.


The same line of thought says that feminism followed the tractor.
As long as hard labor started to be atomized - there was no need in such role division in society, and women started the fight. Upper body does not mean much when you have machines.

Plough is a start of the anthroposphere. The new idea that people can change the world and are somehow main in the world started to emerge.
