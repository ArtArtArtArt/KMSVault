Job is something that you do on non dopamine motivation

*so side projects should be done on dopamine*
*because that is their purpose - side projects exist to excite you, and that is all*
*they also might exist in order for you to do something meaningful - and in that case something other has to be done*

**what if your side project exists for making something meaningful? how can I then do it on only dopamine? like for example the idea of youtube channel on ukrainian? I should do it to influence others?**
*And the answer is - start doing it as a not only side project only when you can be motivated by people's feedback*
