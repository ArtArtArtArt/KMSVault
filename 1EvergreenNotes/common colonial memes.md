conquered lands have no story worth telling - is one of the themes of russian poets of the 19th century

it is clear that it could not be different - if you are a poet in an empire - you have chances to be successful only when you support it ([[world literature]])
So learning Pushkin, Lermontov and Dostoyevsky without noticing these diminishing themes helps them strive in the discourse

Pushkin's depiction of Caucasus is very different to Shevchenko's

Interesting facts:
Afghans and Caucuses are names of not locals - but conquerors of locals

Shevchenko's Maria
Is presumably about rape from the soldier???


The 19th century discourse of Westerners and Slovianophils is essentially a discourse of two imperialistic streams - as Westerners rejected republican and democratic values of the Europe (**need evidence**)
