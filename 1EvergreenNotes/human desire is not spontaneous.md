# human desire is not spontaneous

Zizek - there is nothing spontaneous and nothing natural about human desire
We have to be taught to desire
Cinema is a pervert art - it does not give you what you desire - it tells you how to desire.

*this is why I have to perceive my desires as mostly taught*
**how can this knowledge help me? what tension and in what situations can it release?**
