Transformational line - sentence with I and a deeper personal meaning


I've been really thinking about my life 
About my life is a birthday cake - get rid of it
What's the story of my life and what is the truth of who I am and the answer is I've been really thinking
Then we may use the other side of the same coin (same but from another side - for example - I am always late for work - I am never early, or I never take - I always give)
*this might make a statement stronger*
I've been really thinking - I've not been really living
Deeper truth?
I am confused
The reason - 
I was told that my life was not it was
Get rid of cakes
My life wasn't not what it was
I am not who I thought I was
Deeper truth is that 
I do not know who I really are
(than goes hmm - which is a good sign)
I am stuck
Here is were you write the story and hold on to that

So the story but stay down (it can be even seen with the tone of your voice)

write like you talk don't try to be a writer
