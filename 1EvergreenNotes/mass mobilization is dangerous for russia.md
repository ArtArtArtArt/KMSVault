Mass mobilization is dangerous
It is 1917 scenario

"The people" would have no chance to overthrow the Tsar unless the Tsar: 
1. mobilised them 
2. 2. brought to the capital 
3. 3. trained and gave them guns 
4. 4. made sure they have an immediate self-interest in his overthrow, because otherwise they would be sent to WWI and massacred there

There was a suggestion which tsar rejected 
1. Return the Guard Cavalry (= the richest & most privileged nobility regiments) to the capital 
2. 2. Transfer a part of gargantuan 460 000 conscripts-composed garrison on the capital to police (= hey, we won't send you to war)
3.  3. Get the rest of the garrison out of the capital
