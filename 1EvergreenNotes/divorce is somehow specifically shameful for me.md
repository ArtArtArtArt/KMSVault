# divorce is somehow specifically shameful for me


*but it is very interesting that it resonated with me - I bear something very shameful in divorce and specially in children of divorced parents - should not I get used to the fact that it might happen?*

**Maybe I should think of paths like this - and one of which is that I have no family**

if I am divorced
 - resources - emotionally and financially it will be very hard
 - confidence might be broken
 - I do not like it, it is shameful although a some of my friends are divorced
 - coherence - it is better to divorce then to be in a marriage that is broken (although it feels to me that I will not tolerate hard relations for a long time)
