focus on goal vs mindfulness seem to be a little bit contradictive.

It feels that goals should be set as a set of habits and routines, their visualization might be a motivational thing for you but then you have to actually be present in the moment and be very flexible.

**But the question is - how do I find the balance between doing a little of disciplinary autoritarism for habit creation and mindfulness for being in touch with myself?**
